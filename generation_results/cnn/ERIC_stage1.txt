<mask>A wave of explosions tore through the Israeli city, bringing a shroud of mystery to Israel.<mask>It was the biggest terror attack of its kind against Israeli soil in 60 years, said <p0>, who heads the Israel's <p1>, a new agency focused on the Middle East and North Africa.<mask> <p3>, an analyst for <p4>, a Middle East security think tank, said he was also concerned about the possible impact of the " horrific violence " on Israeli citizens, particularly children.<mask>" Israel is in a situation where there is no limit to the number of people you can get to be in the synagogue, because the violence against the synagogue is an isolated incident," said <p3>.<mask>What's behind the violence in Israel?<mask> <p0> said the " unprecedented and horrific attack " on a synagogue in the West Bank is the result of a very clear ideological struggle with Israel over who should be considered an infiltrator.<mask>The latest violence comes the same day that another Israeli - linked man, a <p2> professor, was arrested in connection with the attack at <p5> in the Israeli cities of Jerusalem.<mask>Israeli Prime Minister <p9> said his government has worked closely with the international community to identify who was responsible.<mask>But <p3> stressed that " all options are open " to the government.<mask> <p7>, who works for <p8>, said the Israeli government's strategy for dealing with <p2> - linked operatives has been one of " self - defense."<mask>" We have a responsibility to fight them and we can't do that without military intervention.<mask>And the fact that we have ( Israeli security forces ) in Israel is a huge responsibility to the international Jewish community, because this is an attack against the whole world, not a security vacuum," he said, referring to the prime minister's <p4>.<mask>He added that Israel must be held accountable for all of the attacks, not only those in the United States.<mask>Still, he said the events are likely to reverberate across Israel's borders.<mask> <p0> added that the Israel government is now trying to " maintain some of its legitimacy, even if we have nothing to hide."
<mask>Dental emergency is a common occurrence, but <p0> has a solution : increasing research on how dental risk factors affect the cost of treatment.<mask>The organization has launched a national application to develop research on the most common factors in dental care.<mask>It will focus on factors like how dental care is changing, how people are going to have their eyes closed and whether they're taking an active role in causing dental diseases.<mask>" The best way to help patients with dental health is to develop strategies that address their underlying health issues," said Dr. <p1>, <p0> medical director.<mask>In particular, she said, the scientific literature indicates how oral health rates are changing in ways that we never had before.<mask>Sens.<mask> <p0> and <p2> have published a study on how attitudes change and the prevalence of oral health trends.<mask>Since 2010, more than 1. 1 million Americans have experienced oral health trauma -- including 60 percent who have died of the disease, according to the 2010 report.<mask> <p2> estimates that the United States will save more than $ 1 trillion over the next decade, even as oral health spending continues to grow.<mask>Over the past decade, nearly 3. 6 million people have undergone dental injuries -- more than twice as many as during the same period four decades ago, Ã la <p0> says.<mask>However, with the growth of the dental health community in particular, the number of deaths from oral health and risk factors is decreasing.<mask> <p3>, dental health experts have noted that the cost increases may be too much, too high.<mask>Some experts fear that a new epidemic of oral diseases might open the door to new treatments that will require less surgery, <p3> said.<mask>Currently, the majority of oral cancers -- with just under 50 percent of them in the United Kingdom -- involve a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and anti - aging, preventing them from going outside.<mask>So how do we know that oral health will have a negative impact on patients?
<mask>A man lost his leg when a train hit him while he was jogging on the Bronx subway train in October.<mask> <p1>, 37, was found guilty Thursday on three counts of drunken endangerment, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a $ 2 million fine.<mask>In addition to the monetary damages, <p1> will be barred from receiving any more than $ 250, 000, said <p2>, a spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney's office.<mask>If found guilty, he would be eligible for a reduced sentence of 30 years, she said.<mask>During closing arguments, jurors in October also said they could decide not to find mitigating factors, including the amount of money the victim's leg was affected by the accident.<mask>The victims -- <p0>, 38 ; <p3>, 40 ; and <p4>, 50 -- were black.<mask>" This has been a difficult trial for Mr. <p5>.<mask>His emotional testimony was riveting," the jury said.
<mask>" We were looking at what destination to go because it's very important," said <p0>, a British - Australian woman who arrived in India after spending a few years living in Indonesia.<mask>" <p5> is always a big destination, but it's not a popular option."<mask>On Thursday, two men assaulted a 23 - year - old woman and her 14 - year old daughter at a train station in the southern Indian state of Assam, killing them and then dragging them to a van.<mask>In <p1>, a 23 year - age woman, her daughter and two of her sons were found dead.<mask>Their bodies have not been identified by authorities, but they have been identified through DNA tests, according to <p2>.<mask>At least 22 women have been charged in connection with the case, <p2> said.<mask>Of them, five face rape charges, and the other has been convicted of murder.<mask>Police are still investigating the murder and rape as a hate crime.<mask>While <p1> remains widely used to visiting India, people have said that it's time for a female passenger to reconsider her destination status.<mask>Many travelers now question the safety of female guests, especially those in Asia.<mask>After the gang rape, many travel to other countries to explore the impact of cultural, economic, social and environmental factors in such a volatile world.<mask>But they can help travelers to take a more cautious approach.<mask>They can help to avoid going to places like Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.<mask> <p3> are key to determining whether a person should go to the country after the attack, and can also help identify those who did not attend a session of parliament last month.<mask>If they didn't, they can still travel.

<mask>Indian oil workers walk on the edge of an empty lot during a strike in February.<mask>About 5, 000 of the nearly 2 million jawans participating in the strike have been told to return to work Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement.<mask>The strike began Thursday after the Indian government dismissed an application from some oil companies to extend the strike to the rest of the country, according to the ministry.<mask>Indian Oil Minister <p3> told the workers that they were owed compensation from <p4>.<mask>But the industrial action by <p2> and the Indian union, the largest in the world, was a " political ploy " by the government to boost demand for oil, <p3> said.<mask>" This is not a dispute about pay or benefits, this is about the fundamental right to self - determination," he said.

<mask>South Korean beef is not open to most U. S. beef imports.<mask>" I don't think we'll open the market to all U. K. beef until after the U. N. inquiry into the slaughtered beef is completed," said <p0>, a spokesman for South Korea's <p1>.<mask>But he added, " We will definitely open the markets for the whole beef."<mask>South Korea will have the largest market to beef produced on the continent, followed by Japan, South Korea and the United States, according to <p3>, the deputy director of the ministry of food relations.<mask>North Korea already sells about 50 percent of its beef to <p1>, according <p3>.<mask>That amount is roughly 50 percent higher than in the Soviet Union, he said.<mask> <p2>, who oversees the beef export process, said that South Korea " will definitely sell some of the beef that is the U.," <p3> reported.<mask> <p4> officials said about 80 percent of the food has gone to China for processing, and some of it ended up in the United Kingdom.<mask>The government is hoping to expand its market, <p0> said, so that consumers may be able to eat more beef produced to meet the U - U. M. beef standard.<mask>South Koreans are already eating more U. <p0> beef than they need because the U.- U. H.

<mask>For much of the year, we've seen the rise of <p0>.<mask>For a while, the <p3> looked the part, but lately, it seems the economy has shown its limits.<mask>At its peak, the economic indicators showed a sluggish recovery and the unemployment rate slowed to 9. 8 %.<mask>The result is that a serious decline in job creation is likely.<mask>To be sure, the economy is still very much a part of the economy.<mask>But it's also a part that has remained relatively stagnant.<mask>I found myself once again frustrated with <p0>'s efforts to stimulate growth and spur employment.<mask>This is part of an ongoing trend that I found challenging.<mask>As an economist, I've written about the economic downturn in the past 20 years.<mask> <p4> and <p5> in particular have been driven by the recession.<mask>When the housing bubble burst, it looked like <p5>, <p6> and <p7> would run out of money.<mask>However, the recession didn't end until 2011.<mask>Instead of focusing on economic growth, <p5> started to invest in the most advanced technology : the personal computer, which has been at the center of many economic stories.<mask>By 2010, the personal computers were becoming the driving force behind many products.<mask>With the help of these tools, our economy has grown faster than anyone had anticipated.

<mask> <p0> illustration shows an Israeli soldier holding a yellow <p1> flag.<mask> <p3>, director of <p4>, said the drawing uses a Nazi salute.<mask>" It doesn't reflect the views of the international community in this regard," <p3> said.<mask>The <p2>, a New York - based Jewish watchdog group, said in a statement Wednesday that it called <p3>'s illustration " an insult to the memory of those who fought in World War II."<mask>The cartoon appears in black and white on the wall near the destroyed Jewish center and in a series of other black - and - white images.<mask>At first glance, <p3> appears to be defending the war against Nazi Germany, which he said was responsible for the destruction of the West Bank and neighboring Palestinian territories during World War I.<mask>But he later says the Nazi swastika appears on the front and is the symbol of Nazi Germany's aggression against Israel.<mask>In a statement, <p1>, also known as <p5>, said : " <p0> is an illustration that reflects a <p6> war against Israel as well as <p7> and other non - Jewish targets in Gaza.<mask>He's using a colorful drawing that he hopes will not draw attention to those Jewish targets."<mask>Watch how anti - Semitic imagery is emerging ».<mask> <p6> Secretary of <p8> <p9> called on Israel " to immediately issue an apology for the offensive against <p7> in Gaza."<mask>" The Secretary of the <p8> deplores Mr. <p0>'s illustration and calls on both <p10> and <p11> to act swiftly against it and to cease the offensive of <p7> into Gaza, the latest terrorist activity, and to immediately stop any further offensive against the Palestinian territories and its infrastructure," the statement said.
<mask>The trial will take place at the Los Angeles County courthouse next week.<mask>While much of the trial is focused on the issue of who paid the late pop icon for a comeback concert, jurors have already heard testimony about who should receive the money and what should not.<mask> <p0> lawyers argue that <p1>'s mother, <p0>, and children -- Prince, Paris, <p2>, <p3> and <p4> -- chose the promoter of the " This Is It " concerts because the money would have been invested in the hiring and supervision of those who hired the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter.<mask> <p4> lawyers argue the money was not a part of the promoter's legal strategy because they wanted the trial to focus on the promoter.<mask>The last week of the 12 - day legal fight was over <p2>'s contract with <p1>, which is responsible for the comeback concerts he has been rehearsing for.<mask> <p2> lawyers argue <p1> chose, retained or supervised <p5>, who was convicted of drug use and involuntary manslaughter, as <p1> had been working for him for several months.<mask>They contend that <p2> used his power to circumvent <p4>'s rules when it hired and retained <p1>.<mask>AEG Live has been sued in court for its " negligently hired, supervised or supervised " Jackson.<mask>Probation papers show that <p0> hired and supervised Dr. <p6>, who in an effort to determine whether <p4> was criminally responsible for his death, failed to follow its own procedures.<mask> <p6>'s lawyers argued he and <p1> failed to establish that <p3> was under contract.<mask>But they also contend <p6> is not liable for <p2> death because of the negligence because <p4> hired and controlled <p1> in the days and weeks before his death.<mask>It has to prove that the company's executives knew about the dangerous treatments he was giving the pop star to treat his insomnia.<mask> <p5> lawyers contend that the concert promoter did not know about his dangerous treatments and that it had never hired him for a rehearsal.<mask>Several of the company lawyers and three other people who worked with the singer as his comeback doctors rehearsed for his " This is It " tour were not fully prepared for the job.<mask>Wednesday's testimony from <p2> lawyer, <p7>, came as much as four days before the trial was scheduled to start in Houston, Texas, where <p2> is scheduled to appear.
<mask>The " Pirates of the Caribbean : On the Caribbean " earned only $ 2. 4 million weekend in the U. S. box office, up from $ 2 million in the week before.<mask>The rest of the top 10 movies were released around the country -- including " The Holiday," which spent more than $ 2 billion at the box office -- but many of them didn't make the weekend.<mask>" We all thought it would be so nice to get to play with our holiday movies," said <p4>, <p5>'s marketing director.<mask>And, while some of the films may be back in theaters in the next few weeks, they're not likely to be.<mask>Despite its impressive box office and box office success -- " Pirates " earned $ 2, 668 million and <p2> netted $ 3, 577 million -- many of which have been the top three - day ticketing weekends of all time -- the big winners may have been a bit trickier to work with.<mask>In the second week after the holiday weekend, <p2> said it's looking to capitalize on a strong box office performance.<mask>It's already the top - grossing movie of all six weeks -- behind only " Avatar," which grossed $ 746. 6 million domestically, and " <p2> " -- the second - highest grossing film of all five weekends, with $ 668. 5 million.<mask>Still, it's not clear whether Hollywood is on the road to a success, either.<mask> <p0>'s latest entry, <p6>, earned just $ 1. 6 mil for the weekend, while " Mission : Impossible : Ghost Protocol " came in at No.<mask>3, taking in $ 1 million -- a big boost for its <p7> - director - star <p8>, who has been making a steady recovery from a drug overdose.<mask>This weekend, he's been cast in the role of <p10>, the superhero hero who gets to save the U, K. in an event that has become more personal.<mask> <p2>'s first major movie, the 2005 sci - fi / fantasy movie " Insurgent," spent $ 649 million in theaters over the past six years, bringing in more than half of that movie's total budget.<mask>But perhaps " Insurface " will remain a big box office draw for the movie, " Ghost Protocol," also starring a young - adult cast.<mask>Other big - budget films are also hitting theaters, including " Mission Impossible : hover around $ 2 and " The Lego Movie," which earned $
<mask>You finally saw it.<mask>You had a double - whammy on your lips, so there was a slight lift.<mask>" This Is the time!"<mask>you thought, pointing at the clock with its perfectly pointed gaze.<mask>As a new piece in the October issue of <p0> magazine lays out our next " musical " steps, we asked the reader to share the steps they'd taken over the last month or so to help us, and we got a call from someone who said, " Oh, what if we just quit playing the ball?<mask> <p1>'s gonna have to go somewhere else to play it!<mask>I can't wait," <p6> said with a smile as she snapped out a quote from the quote, which was posted on <p0>. com this week and quickly picked up on.<mask>Read more : <p5> has a way of conveying to us why we need to play <p7>, to be wary of random strangers who have come on and asked, " Are you out of the way?<mask>I don't want a million bucks to end up doing a bunch of dumb luck with the system."<mask>If you're just finishing up the day, please note that there's been chatter, too, about what could possibly go wrong.<mask>Some bloggers and commenters have suggested that the day is a " date for <p1>."<mask>Other bloggers, such as <p7>'s widow <p8>, say the date is a good day for the song - lovers : " They got the idea while we were on a picnic.<mask>They bought the wrong CD and I thought it was really a great opportunity to showcase my new music," she said.<mask>Don't worry : If your clock sounds like a minute of stale stale air, it's probably because there's nothing on it.

<mask>The court rejected <p0>'s appeal on Monday, ruling that the company was liable for the infringements.<mask>" It is a case of intellectual property and is not related to the underlying patent issue," Judge <p3> told the company.<mask> <p3> noted that the <p4> patent system " protects intellectual property rights and maintains that the companies will not be liable for claims under any circumstance," but added that " we are also confident that the patent law will be applied to any litigation."<mask>The Japanese court had ruled earlier this week that <p6> had reached a settlement of the patent infringement case, according to South Korean media reports.<mask>Last Friday, <p8> Judge <p9> ruled that <p9> had " no duty to enforce " the settlement, according the <p10> news agency.<mask> <p0> filed an appeal of the court's decision, and it was expected to hold a hearing on March 28.<mask> <p11> filed in February showed that <p2> had settled $ 1 billion in claims against <p6> over the <p6> and <p6> tablet, which were copied by <p6>.<mask>Both companies have accused each other of copying designs from the other -- notably <p2>'s <p6>, which went on sale in Asia in September but not before a court in Seoul issued its own ruling.<mask>In April, South Korea's high court upheld the decision.<mask> <p1> said last month that <p0> will continue to pursue a settlement with <p6> until the " parties reach a settlement on its outstanding patent and / or claims for patent infringement are resolved."

<mask> <p0>'s controversial 1933 speech to <p1> about the future of <p2> -- in which he urged the nation not to be " manipulated " by the Nazi ideology.<mask> <p0>, speaking at his Berlin retreat in July 1934, was repeating the words of the Reichstag newspaper -- which <p0> famously said was " true for God," and " true not for life."<mask>On September 21, 1945, as news of <p5> death spread around the world, <p0> delivered the Nazi response to the Berlin address in which the Nazi leadership had reportedly expressed " deep regret and anger " for causing " grave harm to the international community."<mask>He also referenced the example set by <p0>, which on Wednesday described the conditions of the bunker as " absolutely intolerable and inhuman."<mask>The two men exchanged messages between letters and made amends.<mask>According to " I find myself again in the same position that they were during a meeting in Berlin, after which I have to repeat my comments to him that I hope to be reinstated in the leadership of the <p1> as a legitimate representative of the state," wrote the author in his essay, " In the Name of the Father."<mask> <p3>, the author, said : " I also find myself less sensitive to the German idea of having this conversation now than ever before.<mask>" I want to remind you that this discussion was just a matter of one week.<mask>It is only a matter for one week and I cannot be sure if it is true."<mask>But this was the last time that the " Hitler Internet " was mentioned.<mask>The <p1> president and <p6> president are widely credited with creating the Internet and encouraging the digital revolution, but the Internet seems to be the only place where the <p0> accounts are widely shared.<mask>Web usage has been growing on the Internet since the end of March of 2009.<mask>Hundreds of thousands of people have followed up their accounts by following the story.<mask> <p8> has been painstakingly piecing together the accounts from tens of thousands in Berlin and around the globe, compiling a list of the most famous memorabilia of the year.<mask> <p15> has recently collected more than 100, 000 records.

<mask> <p0> is one of the most commonly reported brain disorders in children.<mask>More than half of those diagnosed with epilepsy are adults.<mask>The study -- conducted by researchers at <p1>, <p2> and <p3> -- looked at the prevalence of epilepsy in children ages 4 through 14.<mask> <p0> has a neurofibromatosis that attacks the central nervous system, making it difficult to control the thoughts and emotions that control it.<mask>In the study, the researchers looked at <p3> surveillance data, including those from <p4> in Boston.<mask>They found that about 16 percent of people with epilepsy received treatment for epilepsy, including one in three who had treatment for at least one in four.<mask>Researchers also found that children under the age of 5 had at least five treatment outcomes for epilepsy compared to those under the same age range.<mask> <p2> officials said there were more than two treatments available at the time of the study.<mask> <p6>, lead author of the research, said people have " an overall higher incidence of epilepsy among children who are under five."<mask>" It's really important that we continue to see the full extent of the problem," she said.<mask>" Because this is a broad population, it's important to have a broad spectrum of resources."<mask> <p6> said there are currently more than 2, 700 brain disorders that can affect dozens of people every day.<mask>He said the study will help people get help with epilepsy.<mask>Two experts, who asked not to be identified, told <p1> about the study :.<mask>-- The treatment of epilepsy is not as straightforward as you might think.
<mask>Now a new series of irresponsible political moves is poised to further complicate the situation.<mask>" We have a Democratic majority -- at least four of them ( <p1> Speaker <p2> ) -- so they can raise the debt ceiling," says <p3>, who heads the conservative <p4>.<mask>In fact, one of the reasons <p2> made the switch was in an effort to prevent an increase in the amount of money the <p1> can borrow on its debt limit, as opposed to spending the government on the next fiscal year.<mask> <p0> Speaker <p5> is pushing a bipartisan solution to the debt issue that he is calling one of his top priorities.<mask>Now, with the debt limit increase, many Republicans are now wondering how they can stop it.<mask>How easy is it for <p1> to force a government shutdown?<mask> <p6>, the president of <p7>, is an expert on the relationship between government and money.<mask>According to <p8>, the <p9> has spent $ 718 billion on so - called " big spending " since the start of 2008.<mask> <p8> argues that the majority is necessary to keep the government open.<mask>But the Proposal is aimed at raising the debt amount so that <p1> Republicans can raise it by using more borrowing power in order to fund the government and to pass bills that include health care reform and immigration reform.<mask> <p10> says the proposal would have doubled the federal borrowing limit over the next year, thus increasing the level of borrowing.<mask>The <p4> Republican strategy, however, is a little more expensive.<mask>For the moment, the debt has not fallen from its previous levels and the federal government is running short of money.
<mask>But if the President insists the project is necessary, his administration is at least trying to persuade undecided voters that it is essential.<mask> <p2>, director of the nonproliferation group <p3>, issued a statement saying the " project would create 3, 600 jobs and 830 permanent jobs worldwide " through the pipeline.<mask>This is a great statement of commitment.<mask>" I am very disappointed with President <p2>'s decision to build a 1, 700 - mile pipeline in Canada, but I am also disturbed by the way he has expressed concern for the safety of the <p4> environment and the Gulf Coast," <p2> said.<mask> <p6>, <p2> press secretary for <p7>, says he is " looking at the process " to determine if there is any benefit to the pipeline from its construction.<mask>The project is supported by <p5>.<mask> <p9> is a Canada - based agency that tracks energy production.<mask>When <p2> was elected to the <p7> in 2010, he pledged to build the pipeline as part of a broader project to connect Alberta to the Gulf.<mask>A number of factors, including energy supply and environmental concerns, led to his decision.<mask>But even if the pipeline is necessary for economic growth, reform would be needed to make progress.<mask>While <p0> is trying to get the word out of the public that he has committed to opening up the <p1> project, there has been little evidence from the public or <p2> affiliates to support this project or to urge the President to do so.<mask>On Tuesday, <p1> issued a release stating that the project " shall be completed as scheduled, pursuant to a 30 - year agreement signed by the President in March 2012 and the <p8> administration."<mask>He added, " We will continue to support the full implementation of this project as soon as we see it fully occur.<mask>We continue to work with <p0> in support of this plan, including consultation with our partners around the country."<mask> <p5> spokesman <p10> said he did not comment on specifics of how the project would be funded but said that the <p11> will determine how much work remains to be done.

<mask>President <p0> has been outspoken about his skepticism of the conclusion of the accident investigation by the Korean prosecutor.<mask> <p2> reports emerged this week that investigators have found faulty data on the <p3> ferry's speed, but the president said the ship's speed was too high -- something investigators are now looking into.<mask>" The problem should be handled by the government and the investigation agency," he said in a speech at a conservative religious conference Friday.<mask>On Monday, he rejected <p2> suggestions that the ferry's sinking was the result of faulty data sources, saying, " There is no indication to me that anything was wrong with the ship and the crew.<mask>I want to be clear about that : I think the government was a victim of their own."<mask>In his speech, <p0> is taking the blame for the sinking, saying the investigation is ongoing and it is now up to the coast authorities to determine the cause.<mask> <p0> has called for the full facts to be established to explain the sinking.<mask>His office told <p4> that investigators are " looking into every single thing that is currently available, including the level of passenger capacity in the ferry."<mask> <p5> is currently investigating the sinking of the ferry, and has accused the <p1> of faulty oversight and management.<mask>A report released by <p2> said the investigation has found " strong and consistent evidence supporting the conclusion."<mask>While <p0> did not offer specific guidelines, investigators pointed out that the <p6> ferry ran aground while traveling to South Korea's northeastern border on April 13.<mask>The ferry overturned three days later while it was carrying 55 passengers and crew.

"<mask>The nation's moral compass will be <p3>."<mask>That's the high point of a 2008 presidential campaign.<mask>A poll of pollsters compiled by <p2> released a month after the election showed that 57 % of Americans had confidence that Obama will be a tough justice in the high court.<mask> <p3>, however, said Tuesday the question was " will the court work more well than it did a year ago " and " will give us the ability to work more closely together in the past 10 years than it ever did a decade ago."<mask>Opinion : Why Obama's choice won't solve the election challenge.<mask>In June 2008, just weeks before the elections, <p14> said he had " faith " in the court.
<mask> <p0>, 55, of Guaviare, was arrested Thursday and charged with two counts of rape, incest, sodomy and the unlawful taking of a minor, the state - run <p1> news agency reported.<mask>" The accused did so much to make his daughter feel worthless and to shame him, and to try to control his family," <p1> said.<mask>The arrests came after authorities were alerted Thursday by an anonymous tip, which led them to the farm worker, who admitted raping his daughter and then fathered eight children with her, <p1> reported.
<mask> <p0>, 34, a former World Cup luge champion, collapsed after sliding into a stationary position on the opening day of the Winter Games, <p1> said.<mask>The luge official suffered an injury to his right ankle, according to <p1>.<mask> <p5> had initially called the death a drowning, but the Georgian prime minister intervened.<mask> <p3>, a doctor, told <p6> that <p0> had fallen on the track and died instantly.<mask> <p1> said the Georgian Olympic team was trying to determine the cause of death.<mask>" We have an ongoing investigation into the circumstances leading up to this tragic incident and have no further comment at this time," <p5> told <p7>.<mask>Earlier Friday, <p5> said in a statement that luge athletes and coaches were " saddened by the unfortunate death of one of our competitors."<mask>" Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time," the statement said.
<mask>It's an easy question to answer.<mask>And yet, we can all start asking if we've done enough.<mask>The question we will have to answer is one of the key questions we should ask the international news organizations and journalists about : " How are we covering <p0>?"<mask>Here are five simple answers we can get to the bottom of :.<mask> <p0> video, edited by <p1>.<mask>If you are unable to understand the contents of the <p0> video and have no idea how it's about to spread to all media, please click here.<mask>( The video's subject is the group's leader.)<mask>Once you have access to the video, the <p1> team is able to interview <p0>.<mask> <p4> cannot verify this independently because the cameraman does not have a <p5> license, so you can't edit the video.<mask>To do that, you have to consult <p0> and submit a request to <p1> at <p5>.<mask>On the other hand, if you don't have a license, then they are always working with you and you have no obligation to do so.<mask> <p3> to <p0> or not?<mask> <p5> allows you to see it from <p0> videos.<mask>But the cameramen are allowed to see only what they want, what they are willing to cover.<mask>That's the way it's designed, the way this is designed.
<mask> <p0> of <p1> say congressional pork production in the nation has contributed to a drop in the economy.<mask>The watchdog group's $ 829 million report says the pork industry has contributed a drop of 4. 7 percent in government - spending levels during the current fiscal year.<mask>But that doesn't tell you much.<mask>In fact, the group says, the drop in government spending is related to the recession.<mask> <p4> the report's numbers and vote below you, the public interest group says that this fall, voters are either going to decide on their own about what they want to spend on government and for their own own self - interest.<mask> <p2>, a spokesman for <p1>, said the survey's data showed " a drop by 4. 8 percent."<mask>Watch a report about the watchdog group'anger ».<mask>" This is a big drop in gasoline prices right now," said <p5>, deputy executive director of <p6>.<mask>A <p3> spokesman declined to comment on the study, saying it was an ongoing and ongoing survey.<mask>Still, <p2> said, the government spending panel is a " significant contributor to a decline in government appropriations."<mask>That has led some to believe it's time to go ahead with the program.<mask>Watch how the group finds out about the pork ».
<mask>During the 2008 election, <p0> helped propel the Democrats to victory with his aggressive foreign policy.<mask>He also provided the party with an economic blueprint that made him a strong leader.<mask>During that period, he often became the front - runner on key issues, often setting up battles against Democrats for a variety of reasons.<mask>The <p1> was an example of how he kept control of the <p2> and made presidents look more capable in confronting crises than they were before.<mask>At one time, he used his political power to effectively shape campaign events.<mask>It was the role of the state legislature in <p2> that created the <p3>.<mask>With the approval of the party in 2004 and the Democratic opposition of the 2010 <p2>, <p4> continued to play out.<mask>When the ika voted to impeach <p2> Speaker <p5>, <p3> was able to push his ideas that would have put him in a much stronger position than what had happened under the <p6> administration.<mask>This has been the hallmark of <p3>'s presidency.<mask> <p0> used the power to make the case that <p2> Democrats could be unbeatable.<mask>Although it was not immediately clear if <p0> was sincere in his promises to protect American interests or that his policies were sincere, Democrats did acknowledge that it took him some time to mobilize a coalition that could be capable of confronting challenges that he faced from the very beginning.<mask>As President <p1> and the Democrats have shown, he will have to continue to do so despite a series of setbacks.<mask> <p12> in the <p13> this week, the Democrats are beginning to see a significant opportunity for <p0> to use this election as an opportunity to reintroduce itself to the electorate.<mask>In the months before the election, Obama made it clear that he would not stand by when he turned back the clock on the recovery from a recession.<mask>President <p10> made significant progress on economic recovery during his campaign, but he failed to rally a group of supporters as a result of his economic policies.
<mask> <p0>'s struggles with depression and anxiety led her to describe one in five women : a single mom.<mask>" I want to spend the rest of my life saying,'I have this problem.'<mask>" recalls <p0>, a self - made woman who has overcome her own mental breakdown in the past.<mask>But <p0> took a more positive tone.<mask>The following is a transcript of her response :.<mask>1.<mask>When I had to tell a girl I had an aleside problem, I did not want to tell her.<mask>...<mask>I had to say,'Please don't lie to me.'<mask>My body is already hurting, and I want <p1> to know that I am struggling with this."<mask>2.<mask>I was so consumed with trying to find happiness that I tried to keep trying, even though I had the biggest doubts about it, according to <p6>.<mask> <p0> says : " When I had these terrible, horrible moments, it really opened my eyes to how bad I felt.<mask> <p1> had the greatest feelings in my life and my life.<mask> <p7> I think that's why I was on the defensive for a long time about it."<mask>3.

<mask>People in a certain age when the elderly are most vulnerable to Alzheimer's and other dementia are more susceptible to hearing loss than those with hearing loss, the study suggests.<mask>In some cases, a persistent memory lapse may lead to dementia and, according to the study, people who suffered at least twice in the past 30 years to have hearing loss were more likely to have mild memory problems, which, according the study author, may also influence their future behavior.<mask>The findings appear in the journal <p2>.<mask>" The idea is that if people age 65 and older are diagnosed with dementia, they may have a memory loss in their early 20s that has a disproportionate effect on their condition," says lead researcher <p2>, M. D., an epidemiologist at <p3>, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who was not involved in the research.<mask>( <p1>, the researchers did not examine Alzheimer's or other dementia cases in the study.)<mask> <p9> hearing loss may cause cognitive impairment, memory loss, memory deterioration, and cognitive impairment in young adults, the <p10> says.<mask> <p5> hearing loss has long been an inherited risk factor for Alzheimer's, but the latest study suggests that it may also be an indirect cause of dementia.<mask>For a group of about 200 people, <p6>, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at <p11>, in St. Louis, looked at the ages of some 6, 400 people in the late 1960s and early 1970s to determine the cause of a particular disease that has been known for nearly 50 years, such as Alzheimer's.<mask>They did not detect any unusual Alzheimer's symptoms at age 65, but their findings did raise questions about whether people with hearing problems were as likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and dementia than their risk for the disease.<mask>Health. com : How to stop aging.<mask> <p0> hearing loss is a common memory disorder that is hard to diagnose.<mask>It has been estimated that nearly 40 million people have Alzheimer's in the United States, and some 2. 5 million people in a state that does not have dementia are in similar straits to the United Kingdom.<mask>According to the <p3> report, " This is not surprising given how important it is to treat Alzheimer's."<mask>This is a finding that is not clear from the research ; there is no scientific evidence to link Alzheimer's diagnosis and dementia to early age, the government has said.<mask>And it appears to be encouraging that other researchers may be able to detect this association in individuals with hearing - loss
<mask>A business course offers a course experience for business students.<mask> <p0> is the number one business course offered by <p1>.<mask>" The number of young people looking for business education is in recession now, even though business is booming, despite the downturn," said a spokesman for the school.<mask>However, the number of students looking to attend a business course, even when the downturn means, has remained at its lowest level since the recession began four years ago.<mask>During that period, more than half of the students enrolled in business school were turning to the United States, according to <p3>, chief economist for <p1> in Great Britain.<mask>Speaking at <p2> annual meeting in March, <p4> President <p5> said that despite the economic downturn, students need to improve skills and knowledge in order to become successful in life.<mask>The economic downturn has also forced colleges to boost their programs.<mask> <p3> said that business education programs, which offer free technical training to students, were down 15 percent compared with 2006.<mask> <p5> said the number also fell on a positive note, with the number attending a number of international vocational schools.<mask>A number of European companies, including <p5>, have started offering free technical programs.
<mask> <p0>, a researcher at <p1>, says he's optimistic about the discoveries now.<mask>" The satellite imagery is a huge step in the right direction," he said.<mask>But he cautioned that other discoveries still have to be done.<mask>The military, which has been involved in searching for sites in the ancient city of Luxor, has increasingly been leading the way.<mask>Since <p6> took over in late 2011, it has been able to capture information it can't previously store on satellites, which means a large fraction of Egypt's archaeological sites are lost or damaged.<mask> <p1> has confirmed 126 archaeological sites that it has found, but only 10 were identified by the government.<mask>Some of the buildings on the site are now in " good condition," meaning that only a fraction of them are known to have been destroyed.<mask>In May, it confirmed more than 1, 000 archaeological sites were still in that region.<mask>It expects that <p1> to release more information in the coming months.<mask>Many discoveries of ancient sites have been made through satellites that, like the ones in Cairo, send images back to Earth, where the buildings were built.<mask> <p0> said his team is developing technologies that allow the military to conduct massive searches without interfering with satellites.<mask>Using smartphones, <p1> has already identified more than 70 sites in Egypt.<mask> <p4> images are being used in the excavation of <p7>, in southern Lebanon.<mask>With a handful of sites still in operation, " <p1> is really starting to make a difference on this scale," <p0> said.
<mask>In the Philippines, <p0>, known as Sendong, is one of the most powerful storm systems ever to hit the region.<mask>" I have written to U. S. citizens over the last few years urging them to avoid areas close to the storm that has been affecting this country," <p2>, the assistant secretary of state for international affairs, said in the statement.<mask>On Monday, Although it is not yet clear what is driving <p0>'s ferocious winds, <p2> said the storm is affecting " the most densely populated areas of the country."<mask>It is expected to exact " enormous " losses to the nation as it moves into the next six weeks.<mask>The Philippines has experienced some of the worst flooding in the country's history.<mask>In 2005, more than 200, 000 people were killed.<mask>And in 2007, there were at least 110 fatalities.<mask>But the government's emergency response is focused mostly on the areas that are hit hardest by the storm.<mask>Many of those people were evacuated from towns and cities and taken to safer areas in the areas under a military siege.<mask>There has been no official word yet about what the storm may have had to do with the destruction, nor was there any evidence of the presence of life - threatening injuries.<mask>Tens of thousands of people have fled to safer locations in the south, where much of the economic activity in the area is based.<mask>One person who was killed in a landslide in a predominantly Catholic area of Manila was described in media reports as a man in his 60s, carrying only a pair of shorts.<mask>Several others were wounded.<mask>A fourth was killed when a tree fell on a motorcycle near the Manila International Airport in May, <p8> reported.<mask> <p7> and the military were on high alert for those affected.

<mask>They were among the throngs of lawyers, lawyers and observers on the roof of India's most populous city to witness the trial of the country's former prime minister, <p0>.<mask>The three - day trial is scheduled to begin March 9.<mask>More than 150 witnesses have gathered for the hearing, and proceedings are expected to last only a few hours.<mask>Officials, lawyers, technical experts and the public have been camped out around the complex for weeks on end in anticipation of the hearings.<mask>Some are worried the ruling <p1> party could use the court to bypass its own rules, and try to sway a ruling by a technicality.<mask>" If the trial is to start, it's going to be very difficult to get the outcome of the proceedings," said <p3>, a lawyer from a Manhattan public interest firm that filed a complaint with the court in December.<mask>He added, " I think the trial will be very technical, although we have a reasonable chance of getting it.<mask> <p5>, India's highest court, has said it might be very, very difficult."<mask>India has a massive budget of about $ 15 billion, which the government has insisted is used for tackling corruption.<mask>This year's trial could cost the government more than $ 2 billion, according to the government.<mask>In January, India passed a law that allowed the <p6> to reduce the annual budget to about $ 3 billion per annum.<mask>It also called for the government to spend more on infrastructure -- such as roads and highways -- to meet the ills facing <p6>.<mask> <p7>, a former prime ministerial candidate, is being charged with corruption and could face life in prison if convicted.<mask>Indian Prime Minister <p4> has ordered hearings of the case.<mask>New Delhi is the world's third - largest landlocked country, accounting for more than 18 percent of the global economy.
<mask> <p0> arrived at the airport in San Juan de la Baja, the same place that violence erupted in the aftermath of a brutal government crackdown against political opponents who had gathered there to vote.<mask>Her nose was swollen and she had blood pouring from her mouth, her right hand and lower lip.<mask>" Please don't worry," she screamed.<mask>They took her flight attendant into custody.<mask>It wasn't an accident, but a harrowing one for the mother and her four children.<mask>Thousands of people took to the streets of San Juan del la Babaja in recent months after government troops crossed a violent border into Honduras and gunned down dozens of people.<mask>Central American and international media have reported on the violence, but there have been no reports of major injuries or deaths.<mask> <p4> said that most people will die from their wounds as a result of the government crackdown.<mask>But it is not uncommon for the country's high - profile government officials to try to tamp down deadly violence -- and there is even debate about the wisdom of continuing such operations as the U. S. military's recent surge in aid to Honduras and the Central American country.<mask>More than 1, 800 U. N. humanitarian workers, nearly two years after the crackdown, were flown to <p4> last week.<mask>Many of the workers were from Central America's major cities and have been sent to refugee camps in neighboring Mexico, where they have been treated for burns and other injuries.<mask>And they are all staying in San Francisco, California, to help get relief.<mask>In the <p3> and Honduras, hundreds of thousands of Central Americans have fled conflict, hunger and economic insecurity in their countries.<mask>For them, these humanitarian efforts are part of <p1>.<mask>The Central American government estimates that 60, 000 people have been killed in drug - related violence since the conflict began in December 2006.
<mask>Here's a look at what we've learned so far :.<mask>1.<mask> <p0> military action is now the most decisive phase of the conflict.<mask>In January, Secretary of <p2> <p3> ordered the <p4> to take down the Syrian government's air force and combat rebels.<mask> <p3> authorized the use of chemical weapons against demonstrators and was later asked to reinstate <p5>.<mask>The <p4> also authorized the military's use of the chemical weapons.<mask>A senior administration official said the <p5> regime would conduct an " extensive process " in which the United States was expected to hand over all intelligence pertaining to the use or use of these weapons to the opposition.<mask>2.<mask>There is a strong military presence in Damascus.<mask>And the number of U. S. military personnel in the country has increased in recent months.<mask>At the same time, the military is planning an operation against <p0> regime.<mask>So far, it seems the <p0> has only limited its use of conventional force.<mask>But the military presence is increasing.<mask>On Sunday, <p0> announced a fresh military offensive to protect the government's civilians.<mask>It announced a plan to withdraw its staff from Syria by August 21, and <p0> Secretary <p6> reiterated that position in a speech Tuesday.
<mask>Not only is he a lightning rod for a few weeks, but he's also the lightning rod in the world for many of us : a local sheriff, a hero, a " King of Clay," a retired lawyer and a man with a reputation for being a good thing.<mask>Now, it's <p0>'s turn.<mask> <p3> arrested after video of his arrest showed him smoking crack cocaine in public.<mask>In July, <p1> pleaded not guilty to a drunken driving charge in the <p4> murder.<mask>But his arrest is part of a wider scheme to punish local politicians.<mask>Criminal investigations will continue and more charges will follow.<mask>Attorney <p2> announced <p1> would seek unspecified jail time.<mask>" Sheriff <p0> is a true hero, and he will be brought to justice," <p2> said Tuesday.<mask>The arrest is the second such arrest of a county sheriff this year.<mask>He is now being held at county jail in a county jail and awaiting an appearance before a judge, <p3> said.<mask> <p0>'s arrest, along with the arrests of two others in <p4>, came just over a month after <p1> was arrested on federal charges of driving under the influence and making a false statement.<mask>All charges in the latter case involve drunken driving.<mask>It's all part of <p0> " 100 %" campaign to hold elected officials accountable and ultimately grant them the power to make changes in law.<mask>While the arrest of <p3> may not be the first time that someone has been arrested for making a statement, <p0> has been among those on probation.<mask>At a June 2 hearing in a Washington courtroom, iced tea and pizza.
<mask>In the United States, more than 70 million people have no access to safe drinking water.<mask>The water is safe for use, but there is not much tap water can do to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous metals like <p2>, arsenic, and dysentery.<mask>As Americans know, more people aren't getting their drinking water safely.<mask>Instead, the government's response has been largely reactive : More than 3 million people in the United Kingdom are without access to the tap water and have little or no access.<mask>In fact, about 2. 2 million people do not have access to tap water.
<mask>" I think the issue is a great problem, I think, and I think it's a great issue," he said at <p0>, discussing the recent death of former President <p1>.<mask>" Whether you are a white man or a black woman, and if you're a black man, it's an issue.<mask>But <p2> is about the question of racism," he continued.<mask>Asked if he thinks that " a minority of our citizens " is somehow " brainwashed " into believing that racism is a problem in America, he said, " I think that's a matter of the people."<mask>" It's a issue of everybody's right.<mask>We all have a sense of right and wrong, and we have a right to be scared," he added.<mask> <p2> says he thinks racism is the issue because " people don't realize how difficult it is to define ourselves as this country."<mask>Asked what his thoughts are about the situation after Tuesday's fatal shooting of former Sen. <p10> at a Dallas Cowboys game, <p2> said, '' I think I think everybody in this country understands the issue. "<mask>Speaking about racial relations during a speech in Atlanta, Georgia, <p1> also addressed the controversy surrounding <p11> decision to remove the <p12> from its North Carolina primary after a racially charged incident at the Cowboys stadium.<mask> <p7>, a former <p13> adviser, has criticized the move.<mask>He said that the administration has been " slow to put the issue aside."<mask> <p13> presidential adviser, <p14>, has also weighed in.<mask>She told <p15> that Obama's decision to leave the team was motivated by a desire to work with a diversity of races rather than " a particular group of people."
<mask>Based on the first two episodes, the first teaser clip for the fifth season is a preview trailer for the upcoming zombie apocalypse show.<mask>It shows a group of survivors ( <p1> and <p2> ) battling two demons before being attacked by <p3>.<mask>The scene looks very different than the first, but <p2> is still a survivor and <p4> ( <p5> ) is a bit less threatening.<mask>Fans are already familiar with the series, which returns in March.<mask>They've already been speculating about what direction <p2> will go in the upcoming season and are eager to find out.<mask>What does <p2> have in store for the next two years?<mask> <p1> is a huge character.<mask>He's been training for two months and has a big affinity for the woods, where he and <p3> had a long battle to save and capture.<mask>Since the first trailer premiered on November 4, we've been waiting to see how much time <p5> will have on the journey through his past, as the third season continues.<mask>We know <p1> is back, but it looks like he's still haunted by the events of the first season and the first few months of season five.<mask>There's a lot to be excited about about, but the hints of a new fifth season are just as intriguing.<mask>First, we're getting to see what <p0> will be able to do with his weapons.<mask>Also, we'll be seeing what he has in common with <p13>, <p14> and <p15>.<mask>In addition, we know a lot about where the zombie walker will go next season.<mask>This season is going to focus on a lot of the stuff we've learned so far, like how <p15> will be the focal point of the zombie outbreak.
<mask>The nation's economy is the envy of the world and its inhabitants have been under siege since the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991.<mask>While economic problems had taken a toll on <p1> and tennis players alike, Serbia is still going through some economic difficulties -- and most recently the country has faced harsh criticism over its government's controversial austerity plan for the next financial year.<mask>The current economic downturn has left many of the country's top tennis stars with a chronic income gap that has affected their chances of competing at major tournaments.<mask>And in the aftermath of a similar financial crisis in 2008, the country is facing a similar crisis with the loss of $ 1. 3 billion in prize money that it is seeking to raise to compete in major tournaments like <p7>, <p8> and <p9>.<mask>In order to sustain its status, Serbia has to play golf, attend high school, compete in tennis and play golf tournaments, and have earned a strong reputation as one of the seven <p9> nations of the 20 - strong world.<mask>" It is really a small country with no political history, but we have a very strong tradition of going to the tournaments," said <p0>, a tennis player with <p1>.<mask>But despite the high expectations the country faces, many believe the country still has a long way to go to reach the top.<mask>With a GDP of $ 25 billion and an unemployment rate of 20. 2 %, <p0> believes it will not be able to do that without the support of international players.<mask>He said : " They have very few friends and they really aren't really united.<mask>They don't really know about the world."<mask>Serbia is a big country with a population of just 7. 4 million.<mask> <p5> : Europe's top sporting nations.<mask>Serbian cricket has fallen on hard times with an eye to the Olympics after the revolution that toppled former world No. 1 <p5> in 1999.<mask>It is currently one of soccer's biggest markets, but players are unhappy that a genuine Olympic revival will not take hold.
<mask>The answer, of course, depends on how the candidates conduct themselves.<mask>With 47 percent of the vote counted, <p1> is in second place.<mask>" The question is not which candidate holds the key.<mask>That's the way this country operates," said one Democratic strategist.<mask>Both candidates have acknowledged that polls show the public backs their policies on the economy.<mask>But polls show that 59 percent of respondents say that <p3> has proven that his policies don't work, while 47 percent say that Obama has proven to be ineffective in controlling the deficit.<mask> <p2>'s response to this challenge is to paint himself as the guy who has the " big job " on his mind.<mask>It's all a lie, but the facts :.<mask>One of the key elements of <p3>'s arguments is that Obama's proposals aren't cutting the federal government's deficit.

<mask>But in the world of wizards, these are just the first major developments in the story about <p0>.<mask>As the world's most powerful wizard, <p0>, a <p1> who takes over the power of the Phoenix, is brought in to fight with his dragon, The <p2>, to take over the life of the Lord of the <p3>.<mask> <p0> is a young wizard who has risen from the darkest recesses of his powers to become the ultimate warrior for the <p2>'s people.<mask>He's a wizard who can battle enemies, but has to fight for his own people to get the power and agility to defeat the ias.<mask>If, as it turns out, he's in charge, he has to get out of the way of the dragon to fight the Lord.<mask>In this new " Potter," the most intense duel takes place between the world - dominating characters.<mask> <p4> and <p5> aren't as skilled as <p0> -- they're too slow to fight back.<mask> <p7> and <p8>, two of the two are both eager to find the balance between love and fear.<mask>At the climax, each is so confident that they can battle the other's enemies -- which, in this story, is not the ia -- that they decide to let battle roar over them.<mask>There is a couple of tense moments that leave fans flabbergasted and frustrated and when they're done, they turn to Voldemort to bring the battle to a close.<mask>But at the beginning of the movie, <p7> is eager to go after the villain, not only for love, but also for vengeance, as <p9> puts it.<mask>" Death and the Order of the Red Snitch " opens with a massive battle between the two's evil witches and the evil Voldemort who has turned the entire arena into a dungeon.<mask>The atmosphere is tense and intense at times, with the audience running out of time.<mask>And it's not always this way.<mask> <p6> is keen to play both roles for " Potter " and " The Order of The Phoenix."
<mask>She has been the subject of relentless pressure from the U. S. government and the United States, and she has been outspoken about the need for Iraqi women to be free to vote.<mask>" The only way for Iraqi woman to have an honest voice in life is to give up the right to vote for herself," Edwar said in a phone interview.<mask>But <p1> says the demands of the <p2> government only increase when women are empowered to vote and that the Iraq's constitution will limit them to the lowest level.<mask>She said she has also spent two weeks trying to convince the UGA to give women a vote. "<mask>" We are really afraid that we are going to get an unfair election," Edwani said.<mask>At the height of the Iraq war, women were allowed to vote only sporadically.<mask> <p0> said women were permitted to vote after the elections.<mask>That allowed her to continue advocating for women for rights.<mask>Now, she said, women can't vote anymore.<mask>The Iraqi government is placing restrictions on women's rights as they try to form a new parliament.<mask>It has also put limits on the right of political expression.<mask>In December, <p1> called on the United Nations'permanent members to draft a new constitution.<mask>Iraqi women's activists say this is their first vote since 2005, when Iraq handed the reins to them.<mask> <p1> said this move by the U States would make it difficult for women in the country to get equal representation.<mask>They will need to ask for amendments to the constitution so it can include women voting for women.
<mask> <p0>, in a statement released by her office Tuesday, criticized the imposition of the 20 - child limit imposed on Muslims in Rakhine state, state - run <p1> reported.<mask>Her statement cited a recent survey by <p1>.<mask>" The current limit on Muslim families has yet to be implemented," said <p2>, <p1> deputy coordinator.<mask> <p4>, a human rights activist in Myanmar, said it was based on " a simple premise."<mask>" It was a very simple premise," she said, referring to how the <p7> would be forced to adopt the two - child policy.<mask>Instead, <p2> said, the government would be required to adopt three children with only one biological child and only one third of them with one biological mother.<mask>In the past, <p4> said she had advocated a three - child rule imposed by the military government in which the population is estimated at about 80, 000, but <p8> has not been able to independently verify the figure.<mask>A council official said the new limit was partly in response to a recent influx of the Rohingya, a mainly Muslim ethnic Muslim minority who live in makeshift camps in the country's western border with Bangladesh.<mask>The law has exacerbated the already tense conditions in Rarma, a town of about 70, 000 people that has been under a state of emergency since April 2009 because of unrest.<mask>Thousands have been affected by the unrest, while the violence has also caused at least 80 deaths.<mask> <p8>'s <p9> and journalist <p10> contributed to this report.
<mask>According to Doctors Without Borders, thousands of children have been placed in <p0> -- the country's most prestigious primary school -- because of an outbreak of measles.<mask>" A million children's health facilities in the city, like the one in the university, have been destroyed.<mask>...<mask>This is very alarming.<mask>I have never seen such devastation.<mask>This will affect thousands of women, children and their families," said MSF Director - General Neath Mounoubadhese, speaking at the annual conference.<mask>On Monday, about 1, 000 people, mostly women, were treated at a health care center on the outskirts of Kampala.<mask>In one of the most desperate areas, <p1> is distributing intravenous medications for infected children in the most vulnerable parts of the city -- as well as to newborns and children under the age of five.<mask> <p3>, many of these children have had to go outside to receive treatment.<mask>What they do find is a lack of access to clean water.<mask>That is why many parents, like thousands of others who fled the country, are afraid to return to their communities.<mask>Their fears are all being exaggerated by MSF, which often cites the Uganda - Tanzania border as one of its top priorities.<mask>They do not want to risk their lives to take on their patients, and it's difficult to reach a charity that can help them find an affordable option to care for their children.<mask>Some donors have turned away to MSF instead of donating to charity.<mask> <p5>, a nonprofit group that provides care for disabled children in Uganda, says that <p0> has given $ 2 million so far to the children.
<mask>The new <p0> ( <p1> ) is a futuristic project to build a network of warehouses, restaurants and shopping malls across the UK.<mask>But as the build progressed, it became increasingly clear that the building would need to be developed at a higher speeds to meet demand for a commodity.<mask> <p2> by the private sector, it has been building warehouses and warehouses since the 1970s.<mask>Together the warehouses and retail buildings it manages are the world's largest container shipping company.<mask>Most of the goods can be shipped from London to other countries, but since the completion of the project in 2009 the shipping company has been moving towards the construction of hydroponic farms across the country.<mask>The process to build the facilities will take less than three years to complete and will take years.<mask>" We will do all we can to scale the production and transport capacity and ensure the development is rapid.<mask>At the same time, we will be able to increase capacity to a maximum of 30, 000 of the 40, 000 warehouse space across the site.<mask>It is a huge step in the right direction," the company said in a statement.<mask>What started as a small project, <p2> ( BUZN ) is currently the world largest container facility for the food industry and has now grown to an estimated 40, 500 acres and currently will produce up to 40, 200 kilowatt hours a day.<mask> <p9>, a plant manager at <p10>, says the <p1> will also deliver goods for around 12 years from October 2013.<mask>He says that during this time the company is planning to be involved with the production of 20, 000 containers per day.
<mask> <p0> carts have the same look, shape and feel as golf carts, but instead of simply being used as a trading cart, they have been engineered as a luxury travel cart.<mask> <p1> carts have been marketed in the form of luxury goods such as golf balls, sunglasses and even <p2>, making them popular with the American public.<mask>" There was a lot of demand in the past 10 years," says <p1>, chief executive of <p3>.<mask>He says there has been a 50 percent increase in the number of people using the carts as a travel accessory -- and some of the carts are the most popular on the road.<mask>In fact, <p1> says there were 100 sales worldwide during the first 10 months of 2012 and the figures for the first two months have been updated.<mask>However, <p2> says he still does not expect the sales figures to increase much, although his customers have shown growing demand for the goods.<mask>"( They are ) saying they will continue to offer people traveling on the equipment," says said <p1>.<mask>Read this : Private jets race to save lives.<mask> <p5> carts have a high - end value, he says.<mask> <p6> carts are made from lightweight materials, which is the same as golf ball caddies and other travel equipment.<mask> <p8> carts have also been modified to include a rotating cart for <p9> and the Ryder Cup.<mask>The <p6> cart is made from an industrial composite material -- similar to a golf cart -- but it's not entirely an aesthetic.<mask>Made from stainless steel, <p5> and other materials, the cart uses air and a temperature - controlled carbon dioxide to make it more reliable for traveling.<mask>While there are differences in weight between a golf ball and a cart, <p6> maintains it is a reliable transport vehicle.<mask>It's also an efficient vehicle, enabling it to compete with any other vehicle for the same distance and emissions.

<mask>Here are some answers to the question.<mask>• The American people deserve better.<mask> <p0> funding to create new health - care systems has been consistently high, but in the first decade of the 20th century, the U. S. government greatly reduced innovation and increased the government's involvement.<mask>At the same time, policymakers, medical practitioners and researchers have moved from promoting new medical innovations to supporting it.<mask>Yet our nation's leaders are failing to take this fight to the next level.<mask> <p6> has passed a staggering $ 962 billion in unnecessary spending on the medical system, and <p7> has approved $ 400 billion to fund new therapies -- many of them completely unnecessary -- while <p8> has passed just over $ 400 million to cover research and development costs.<mask>If we were spending our time to develop a medical innovation system, the $ 3. 6 billion funding would also have supported more research, development and research that has brought our nation closer to economic stability and security.<mask> <p4> of the <p9> data show that the majority of innovation is fueled by government funding.<mask>The government spends about $ 12 billion a year on medical innovation.<mask>According to the <p6> data, Americans spent $ 1. 7 trillion in 2011, up from $ 1 billion in 2011.<mask> <p3> - related spending has increased in 2010.<mask>However, this spending exceeds <p4> spending by $ 1 trillion.<mask>But there is much more research and taxpayer aid available to address our health care needs at this time : <p6> and <p10> require additional funding to fund the creation of affordable, high - quality medical facilities that will deliver real health care and prevent the costs of costly treatment.<mask>On top of that, <p0> funding is expected to be scaled back by the mid - to high - end of this year.<mask>So what exactly is <p0> doing to spur innovation?
<mask>We know you've had your fill of " Full House " rumors, but it's time for the <p0> to do something about it.<mask>You're in for a reunion.<mask> <p0> reports the network is planning a TV reunion for the mid - 1990s.<mask>The stars of the cult hit comedy will return for a third season ( though no other details have been revealed ), and <p0> says fans of the <p1> sitcom would love the chance to see <p2> and <p3> ( <p4>, not <p5> ).<mask>" Full House," which returns on December 13, also stars as the show's creator.<mask>So will there be a reunion?<mask>" I think there's gonna be rumors," said TV producer <p6> of the possibility.<mask>" One of the things I would really like to see is <p7> in the film and <p2> playing <p8> again, <p9> as <p10>, <p11> as <p12>."<mask> <p10> is also a TV producer on the series.<mask> <p7> recently cast <p3> in a new film and is rumored to be making a movie about her.
<mask>" I feel a mixture of sadness, sadness and sadness," <p0>, the Arizona Republican who represents Giffords, said after announcing his resignation.<mask>" But I feel even more blessed that she's in this job, and I will continue to work hard to achieve a better tomorrow for my community."<mask> <p2>, Giff Giffgo and <p3> -- the latter two congressmen killed in the shooting -- are Republicans and Democrats.<mask>In their first - ever confirmation hearing, both had promised to take action in support of the Arizona law.<mask>The two had also indicated their disagreement about the benefits of the law on Giffby and their stance on it.<mask>They said they had been working together to discuss the law with their staff, the committee's staff and others.<mask>After the hearings, the Republican and Democratic parties announced their plans to meet for a " special session of <p4> " on Thursday to discuss future legislation.<mask>One of the most prominent Republicans to turn down <p8>'s request, <p9>, has called the offer to resign a " mistake."<mask>" A mistake is made by Republicans," <p9> said in a statement.<mask>Republican Rep. <p10> of Michigan, a close Obama confidant, noted on Tuesday that Giffard has not indicated that he will step down, but noted that some potential replacements could be included in the bill and could include representatives from the Arizona Senate.<mask> <p0>, a Democrat from the Tucson, Arizona, district, said he was " very disappointed " to hear of <p1>'s decision.<mask>He noted that Gough had recently served as a member of the <p8> and the <p11> and the " thoughts and prayers " of Giffiffords have been with her.<mask>Giffords " is a true warrior " and an " inspiration," <p7> said.<mask>She has also served in the <p21> and in a number of capacities, including teaching and writing.
<mask>That means that phone owners, the vast majority of Americans, have a hard time stopping the overwhelming volume of calls that are making their way around the office clock.<mask>Increasingly, these calls are hitting voters with the potential to change their everyday behavior -- and even make their way through the media.<mask>But why does this impact the election?<mask>A recent Pew survey found that only about 18 percent of U. S. voters express an opinion of their political choices ; in fact, only 26 percent of Americans say they receive a phone call every day.<mask>This means that, while the number of calls increased in 2009, the number received by phone owners in the U. K. increased by almost half between 2009 and 2010.<mask> <p3>, a new telephone survey in the United States found that 55 percent of respondents -- or nearly 1. 5 million -- of Americans had no opinion of how they voted.<mask>That's more than a quarter of respondents said they had a negative view of the election, while 40 percent said they thought it was too early to determine whether the election was really going to be a tossup.<mask>" I don't think that a lot of people would disagree with the results of the survey because the results were more positive than the results," said Pew, a research scientist at <p4>.<mask>According to <p0>, this disparity is particularly pronounced in battleground states.<mask>The <p6> survey found in battleground areas such as Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and New Hampshire, the " most important battleground states " in the election season are those who do not believe in government, but who are concerned about the effects of government on their personal lives.<mask>These fears have led to the rise of <p1>, or <p7>, an automated voice - mail system ( <p8> ) that has evolved into a mobile system.<mask> <p5>, a <p9> professor of telephone science and computer science, points out that mobile phones have already changed the way people communicate.<mask>To the <p4>, the <p8> is an " antidote to all the noise, texting, and other noise from the electronic system."<mask> <p6>'s <p10> and <p11> contributed to this report.
<mask>Rescue workers wait for the bodies of a collapsed crane on Java Island on Thursday.<mask>Roughly 4, 000 people are on the island, where the 7. 9 - magnitude earthquake struck Thursday, according to aid agencies.<mask>At least eight villages were destroyed or badly damaged, the aid agency said.<mask>It said the number of casualties was probably higher.<mask>The quake killed at least 39 people, mainly from the main town of <p7>, about 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) south of <p8>.<mask> <p0>, spokesman for <p9>, said more than 300 people were missing.<mask>He said more bodies had been recovered from <p2>, the island's biggest tourist destination.<mask> <p2> is about 155 kilometers ( 95 miles ) from <p10>, where a mudslide buried some houses, leaving the area with no electricity.<mask>As many as 1, 500 households were affected by the quake, said <p1>, a spokeswoman for <p11>.<mask>Indonesia's <p3> suspended rescue operations Thursday and said the death toll could climb.<mask>However, at least 10 villages were also without electricity, a spokesman said.
<mask>Was the voice mover on the <p0> jet supposed to be the voice of a cockpit pilot at the controls of the plane?<mask>Or did the voice be that of a pilot during takeoff?<mask>And would a pilot still have the right to use an electronic device?<mask>The answer is no.<mask>The plane was flying in a normal flying hour, at 35, 000 feet and at 30, 000 mph, at the time of takeoff.<mask>On Friday, the <p3> announced it would allow a pilot to use electronic devices during takeoff and landing.<mask>But there are concerns the technology could be used by pilots, passengers and crew to transmit and receive voice signals and record audio, a <p1> spokesperson said.<mask>" The cockpit voice will not be recording the voice signals or other sensitive or irrelevant voice signals that might be transmitted to pilots during takeoff or landing," said <p9>, a spokesman for the <p10>.<mask> <p12> banned electronic devices at takeoff and landed in 2012, citing safety concerns.<mask>Airplanes can transmit and analyze cockpit voice signals as well as information transmitted via a computer.<mask> <p0> CEO : E - mail to a friend.<mask>According to the <p13>, the voice data will be included in future versions of the airline's electronic devices.<mask>In 2011, there were about 1. 7 million such devices aboard commercial airlines.<mask>This year's figure includes 81 million.<mask> <p4> devices use sound - canceling headphones and a host of other portable electronics, including tablets and e - readers.

<mask>The summit's purpose, according to African leaders, is to help address issues in Africa and promote trade, investment and investment in Africa.<mask>The meeting, at times dubbed " The Group of 20 summit," is an opportunity for African leaders to talk and engage collectively about the challenges they face as an economic power.<mask>A key part of this summit is the need for leaders to reach across the Atlantic to hold the same summit.<mask>As with previous gatherings in Kenya, Ghana and the United States, leaders are expected to travel to the region to try to forge a trade deal, foster economic growth and address issues like climate change.<mask>But the summit itself is being billed as an opportunity to provide an opportunity of opportunity to improve economic conditions for African countries, especially those in developing countries, and to send President <p1>, the first African president to attend.<mask>That's because African leaders are often at odds with one another over a broader set of issues.<mask>African leaders have always been viewed as moderate but for their nations, particularly in the Arab world, and sometimes have more to say.<mask> <p7> was the highest - profile to discuss the issue, with Ghana, Burundi and Sudan among the top leaders.<mask>Africa's summit has also produced significant progress in its efforts to promote economic development.<mask> <p9>, the continent's largest African nation, has been in the lead on efforts to reform the way people consume, fuel consumption, and pay for health care.<mask>And even though the summit has been an important signal of progress, Africa is still lagging behind in terms of trade and development.
<mask>The phone is <p0>, an HTC Y - phablet that's so adorable, so darned gorgeous and so nice that you can't see its eyes.<mask>Its camera is a little bigger than a real phone but it has a bigger battery, and the Re's camera has a 3. 5 - megapixel rear camera.<mask>HTC says its <p2> has been around for 10 years and it makes a good phone call for the new <p0>.<mask>But it has been clunky.<mask>The <p0> has a smaller battery and a larger sensor, so you can see the precise times and locations when your phone's in use.<mask>It's a lot like a smartphone, but with a much larger battery, the chances of getting a bigger phone on the market are slim.<mask>" This makes sense for us because we know when there are fewer phones in the market and we can use the devices in a way that's not going to be seen in other smartphones," <p1>, chief marketing officer for <p3>, said in a post on the company's blog.<mask>In the <p0>'s case, it's designed to be more portable than the current iPhone 3S or the 5G.<mask>( HTC says its camera can go 3G or 3G and convert it to a Wi - Fi standard ; if <p0> can get a phone that's 3G only, that's a great feature.)<mask>The company plans to release the new device in the next few months, and it should be released by <p5> and <p6>.<mask> <p5>'s <p2> is already available, though not on the same level as the 5GS.<mask> <p0> is still a fairly early launch in this field, although it will have a few more days to prepare for its new <p7>.<mask>Like the 5S, <p2> will have high resolution storage and a 1. 4 - megapixels in contrast to <p4>'s iPhone 4S.<mask>So, it will probably have a faster processor than the 5's.<mask>I've been impressed with the camera, and I don't think it's going to change much at all.
<mask>But what would Hollywood need to star in a movie to bring his name to the screen?<mask>A star who seems to be unafraid to break into a box office world?<mask>In his 2001 debut film " Enter the Dragon," he grabbed audiences with his unique take on kung fu, his striking moves and his trademark dance moves -- all in competition with some of the biggest names on the planet, including <p1>, <p2> and <p3>.<mask>Now 42, he is taking his own approach to making films, and he is using his celebrity status to his advantage.<mask>With his spectacular martial arts moves, <p1> shows off his latest film, " Enter The Dragon."<mask>It features him as a martial arts master.<mask>He is also known as a master of karate moves, and his latest effort is a surprise hit.<mask> <p0>'s latest venture is " Enter <p4>."<mask> <p0> is currently making movie versions of his hit " Enter," but there is no direct relation to his latest movie, " Fist of Fury."<mask>In fact, the three - time " Enter " film is already on the small screen in Japan and he has already made some initial auditions.<mask>However, in his current career he hasn't yet finished earning his Best Actor award and remains an unconventional unconventional target.<mask>" When I first started working on karate, it was only a few months before I began shooting, and I didn't realize that karate was such a dangerous genre," <p0> told <p5>.<mask>So what motivated him to develop the genre?<mask>" I had thought that martial arts was the next genre and now I want to bring it to the big screen," iced <p0>.<mask>In 2001, he directed <p3> " The Gun " and produced " Tropic Thunder."
<mask>The Burj Khalifa will be the world's highest building.<mask> <p0> told <p1> that he hopes the Burj tower will be completed by the end of the year.<mask>" It will be a world - class building," said <p0>.<mask>He added that he is ready to test the idea on the West Coast.<mask> <p3> have been working to build the Burri Khalifa in Riyadh in the hopes of keeping the building on target for years, but it was rejected by <p4> on March 15.<mask>A group of representatives of the construction company, however, said the project is progressing smoothly.<mask>In an interview with The Observer in London, <p0> said he was confident the building would be verified as the world record.<mask>It was his third project since <p5> took over the reins of Saudi Arabia in 2004.<mask>When contacted by <p1>, <p6>, a spokesman for the <p7>, declined to comment.<mask>However, in a letter to <p3> magazine last year, the prince said he had been working with the company on construction since 2002 and was impressed by the technical and engineering aspects of the project.<mask>The prince has been involved in development of Saudi - made projects in the past, including the Riyadh Town Hall in 1992, where he worked on a construction boom and <p0> is the patron of <p8>, a major sponsor of <p9>.
<mask> <p0>.<mask> <p2> is charged with capital murder for the death of 16 civilians who were part of an attack on an Afghan men's outpost in September 2009.<mask> <p11> officials told <p12> on Friday that <p2> spent an estimated $ 16 million to assist <p13> <p14> during his career as an adviser.<mask> <p1> is currently in federal custody.<mask>He faces a first - degree murder charge in the deaths, and an investigation is ongoing.<mask>Federal prosecutors allege that <p6>.<mask> <p8> in a statement said he skipped out on an initial payment as a financial adviser during his time in Afghanistan as a <p14> adviser.
<mask>It's really sad.<mask>There's no justice for our justice," said a voice heard over a recording of an interview conducted last week.<mask>A white police officer from Wisconsin was shot and killed by the <p0> on August 17, after he opened fire on a <p1> convoy.<mask>The video has since been posted to <p2>.<mask> <p0> <p3> was taken into custody by police and was later released.<mask>" We will investigate the <p2> incident and ensure that justice is served in the case," <p3> said.<mask>It was a sentiment echoed by several law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin during the investigation into the shooting.<mask>Wisconsin has become a major flashpoint for racial tensions in the wake of the shooting death of a unarmed African - American man in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 19.<mask>And that includes a video that shows the officer, who is black, with the suspect looking straight into a crowd and a large chunk of the suspect's hair pulled off <p4> sweater.<mask>As the camera pans to the background, another voice could be heard chanting, " The police have no justice!"<mask> <p3>, an attorney representing <p5>, said it was an " incredible " call by the shooter.<mask>He added that it was a " ridiculous call from the urchins, who believe that the police are wrong and trying to silence the shooter."<mask> <p7>, a member of Wisconsin's <p8>, told <p9> the shooting is a " very ugly call " made by the officer's partner, <p10>.<mask>"( He ) said he wants justice," Hood said, " because he's an experienced prosecutor."<mask> <p5> was released on bail in October, and his next hearing is set for February 12.
<mask> <p0> and <p1> were cast as <p2> and <p3> and <p4> respectively as <p5> and <p6> <mask> <p4> as <p7> and <p8> as <p9>.<mask>But the storyline is in flux, and <p9>'s reps told EW that they're planning to keep both men.<mask>" It seems like <p3> is a very good fit for the series and a great guy.<mask>I don't think anyone's really surprised about the fact that <p4> is leaving <p3> for <p10>," <p11>, <p12>'s executive producer on the series, told EW.<mask> <p0> recently told <p13> that he was planning to depart from the show, but " honestly, I'm not.<mask>Obviously, I still feel like I have to continue to get some sort of break up with <p1>, but I'm going to have to make it as long as I can."<mask>See the full article at <p7>. com.<mask>CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of <p0>.<mask> <p13> and <p14> All rights reserved.
<mask> <p0> said he boarded the bus on March 9 to complain about his daughter's behavior at school.<mask>" I have a 5 - year - old who is very, very, outgoing, intelligent and very thoughtful about everything," he said in an interview with Miami - Dade radio station WFTV.<mask>The father's comments came a day after his daughter was taken from the bus and flown to a hospital, according to his daughter, whose father said he was afraid of her.<mask>When <p4> spoke to <p5>'s <p6>, the father said " she had been boarding the bus with a list of people she thought was suspicious of," including her father.<mask> <p5>'s interview with <p1> came a week after he was accused of sending text messages to students, including some of his daughter.<mask>In a statement to WFPD, he said the school district asked him to leave the bus.<mask>But, he added, " <p0> didn't want to go with me.<mask>So I sent him the text message.<mask>I told him that I wasn't going to be on the bus because I felt I was getting a lot of bad press and I wasn'hiding or being a bad father'and <p4> said I didn't really want to get off the bus."<mask>" <p0> said if he would've taken the bus, I would have been out with him and called my mother."<mask>After getting off, <p0> was taken to a local hospital and questioned by police, according a criminal complaint.<mask>He was given a two - year psychiatric hold.<mask> <p1> affiliate <p7> reported that <p0> told police he was placed on a mental health leave.<mask>Last week, he had been admitted to a mental hospital and denied any wrongdoing.<mask>His wife, <p7>, said he has had issues with depression and anxiety at times, but said the family was taking him to therapy.
<mask>She couldn't hold her head up, her eyes glazed and her body ached, and she was desperately attempting to turn the news of her dead body to some.<mask>But the pain in her lungs didn't last long : She died in the weekend's rescue of <p1>, the only body found in the waters off the southern Australian city of Perth.<mask>As bodies lay in the water, she managed to grab hold of a broken linen suit and pull it over her head and hold it up for safety.<mask>" I couldn't stop smiling," Weeks said of her death.<mask>She was at a loss for words.<mask>The 33 - year - old New Zealander was the lone survivor of the boat accident.<mask>He had been rescued from the water on December 5 and was expected to survive.<mask>His wife, <p3>, and their 17 - year old daughter, <p4>, were among three passengers rescued from a wave that washed away the family boat.<mask>Her body was found Saturday in the western Australian city's waters, some 60 kilometers ( 25 miles ) away from the submerged wreck site.<mask> <p2> crews were still searching for bodies aboard the sunken boat on Monday, after two days of painstaking efforts to extract victims from the bottom of the sea.<mask>Australian Prime Minister <p4> and his Australian counterpart, <p5>, met with survivors at the scene Monday to offer them the first glimpse of how they feel after the crash.<mask>Some survivors told <p1> they were stunned.<mask>One, <p2>, said he was overwhelmed.<mask>Wounded, he said, had to hold on to his head.<mask>Other people told him they had lost hope too.
<mask>This past weekend, a small handful of protesters -- in the middle of the night -- came out at dawn to take their iconic red - and - blue - colored hats away from the throngs of police officers who have blocked off streets around the capital.<mask>" There was no protest," said <p1>, a 34 - year - old college student.<mask>His students have been protesting what the government says is illegal activity that targets those with political agendas.<mask>They've had to endure harassment for more than 30 days.<mask>A police spokesman said " There are no protests."<mask>But the march is not a protest, but an attempt by the protesters to force them to leave their demonstrations.<mask>Some have even taken to the streets to demand that security forces step down.<mask>At least three protesters were detained on Saturday, including a police officer and three journalists.<mask> <p2>, a freelance journalist, said he has been given a marching order from the head of security.<mask>He said he was not allowed to leave because of his government's tight grip on the internet.<mask>The security forces have tried to try to prevent people from using the internet and cell phone in Egypt.<mask> <p1> said he could not explain why people who were allowed to enter the rallies were not able to do so.<mask>But he has said there is no protest in Egypt, which has been ruled by a military coup.<mask>Cairo has one of the most popular internet systems in the Middle East, with 4. 5 million users.<mask> <p6>, a 29 - year veteran of <p7>, became the first person arrested this weekend.
<mask> <p0> said Sunday that it would be a good idea to have <p1> in Iran as president for a few weeks.<mask>" Iran is in trouble right now, because they have gone down in history and they are very angry and very determined to try to change the system," said the Nobel laureate, who was born in Tehran.<mask>In fact, <p0> said, Iran has consistently responded to U. S. criticism of the Islamic Republic.<mask> <p3> and Israeli officials are investigating allegations of interference in Iranian internal affairs, but the report appears to focus on an alleged U. N. security plot against Iran.<mask>The report, which cites unnamed Iranian officials and <p4> officials, was leaked to the media by news agencies, <p5> and <p6>.<mask>According to <p2>, an <p4> spokesman, <p1> was arrested in the UAE on Friday and was being held under " house arrest " because of the cables.<mask> <p0> added, " I don't know of any specific cases where a U. K. government official made comments about Iran. As far as we know... it's all about Iran's relations with the United States."<mask>Iran is not <p1>'s heir apparent, but his father is in office, as is the nephew of his father, a leading Islamic cleric.<mask>It's not known whether <p0> would attend the funeral, however, that his father might do so.<mask>Some say he might have to, " If the president was there, <p3> would not have done the funeral," <p7>, a longtime Iran analyst who has written books on Iran and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Forum at <p8>.<mask> <p1>, a <p9> professor, has authored two books on the issue, the first being " The Rise of the Shah in Iran and the Other " published in 2002.<mask>He has written two books about the <p8> regime and has also written a new book about Iran, " The Fallibility of the Prophet Mohammed."<mask> <p1> is one of the best - known scholars in the region.<mask> <p7> said Iran would likely face sanctions if <p0> were to participate in the funeral.
<mask> <p0> will go to London for his final shows.<mask>The show, scheduled for July 7 - 10, will be <p1> first international tour in 17 years, according to <p2>, the concert's promoter.<mask> <p0> announced Thursday he is leaving London to pursue " various artistic opportunities," including a new career as a songwriter.<mask>He will then complete his 10 - year run as <p4>.<mask>" I feel it's right to bring this to my fans for a final performance," said <p3>, Jackson's manager.<mask> <p2> said he had received offers from various artists and was " delighted " by the " incredible outpouring of support " from fans.<mask>After his announcement Thursday, <p0> said that he would be closing his eight - year London career by " the end of the year."<mask>" As a songwriters, I've always loved performing and I've absolutely loved performing with <p4>," he said in his statement.<mask>His next concert is set for London in July, he said.<mask> <p1> and <p5> will also perform at the <p6> in London on July 9 and 10, <p2> said.
<mask>And, of course, we also have no princes or duchess standing in a royal family imposing such absolute monarchy.<mask>And what about that?<mask>The reality is, they are in a sort of royal palace.<mask>But if you ask historians, experts and archaeologists whether the United States has a particularly special history on the importance of monarchy, that's probably because they have so much to offer us.<mask>We've even been told that if you count a couple of princes who have their own royal castles and are building them, it would be because they are powerful people.<mask>In fact, <p5> has so much power over us that he even invented the " queen's castle," a reference to the queen's great - great - grandparent.<mask>For example, when he built the first U. S. U. N.- built wooden palaces in 1776, his palace was considered to be the only royal palace in the world that actually existed in Britain.<mask>It was actually a one - story brick house that held only two princes, and when he moved into it in 2000 he made himself a guest of the new monarch's.<mask>He was a royal, so obviously, it's a little strange.<mask>Other than that, he was able to build a palace for a living.<mask> <p3>, king of England, built a royal palaces that are as good as any in England.<mask>The ornate <p9> building in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, actually exists in part because of the building's location, though it's actually named after the 1805 building.<mask>Why?<mask>Because it was built under the patronage of an affluent patron saint, <p1>.<mask>When he was a boy he bought <p6>, the property of his older brother, who happens to be named after him.
<mask>" I can't believe the doctors are making this much progress," Dr. <p0> told <p1>'s " New Day."<mask> <p0> said Giffords is recovering from a skull fracture and continues to be closely monitored, and doctors have told her they expect " miraculous progress."<mask>" She is just a beautiful young lady," Dr Dr. Dr. Yoosoof <p2> said.<mask>" The last time I saw her was a week ago."<mask>The shooting that left six people and six others dead has been widely reviled in the U. S. Congress.<mask>Earlier this month, <p1> was moved from a Houston intensive care unit, where she is being treated for a gunshot wound to the head.<mask>Her condition has been upgraded to " critical to serious," said Dr. and <p5>.<mask>She has not regained her speech, but a doctor and a friend told <p6> that her recovery is " pretty miraculous."<mask>She is still being monitored by Houston's medical staff.<mask> <p1>'s condition has increased slightly since Tuesday, when she was taken to a Houston hospital and placed under a medically induced coma.<mask>According to <p0>, Giffed " is getting better and better every day."<mask>A statement released earlier Tuesday by the office of Houston's chief medical officer said that " the doctors and nurses of this facility have shown extraordinary care."<mask>And the office's spokesman, <p8>, said that while Giffes'counsel was in the courtroom, she was " not allowed to leave the courtroom because of the outpouring of sympathy that her family and friends have received."<mask>Her husband, former astronaut <p23>, said Wednesday that his wife and former astronaut, astronaut <p24>, was " tremendously grateful " for the care she's received and the outpourings of support from the public.<mask>As part of that, " <p1> has been able to talk about her recovery and progress," <p2> told <p9>.

<mask>With a beachhead?<mask> <p0>!<mask>No, not a beachfront.<mask>With tongues wagging, a beach - bum in the Southwest will be none other than the " Godmother " -- and the " Lady in the Green " -- in the mix.<mask>For nearly 20 years, <p5> has been documenting the birth of Christ on a tour bus.<mask>Now, according to <p3>, some 500 people have visited the <p6> and <p7>.<mask>Some of the group's tour stops include a beachhouse in New Orleans ; an indoor swimming pool in Austin, Texas ; a " home of kings " in Dubai ; and a beach house in St. Augustine, Florida.<mask>But all of it is happening on a bus, and there are plenty of activities to take you by.<mask>See the list of tours.<mask>The tour is part of the ills of the Southwest :.<mask> <p7>. org is offering the public, including those from <p6>, <p8>, <p9> and <p10>.<mask>Though <p6> is a place that attracts a lot of visitors from all walks of life, it's also known for its large, diverse and scattered crowds.<mask>" It's a way to see the world and celebrate what God has for us and the world that he's chosen for us," said <p6> organizer <p11>, who recently attended the <p12> festival.<mask> <p1>'s most popular tour stops in the United States are San Francisco, Dallas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis and San Francisco.<mask>While the tour stops, there is no guarantee that you won't find a beach in the city.
<mask>We're seeing this in cities across China in which they've already set ambitious objectives.<mask>We are also seeing this here at the Urumqi Film Festival, where the city prepares for a three - day series of screenings and exhibitions at the Chinese pavilion.<mask>It will also offer one of the first foreign films to be screened in China on state - run networks.<mask>All told, the Chinese space program will deliver three times that amount of international competition -- and that's going to be impressive.<mask>In the past, the country has announced it wants to lift the country out of a nuclear crisis by 2020.<mask>But there are also plans to open up a new space cooperation hub in the capital, <p0>, in mid - 2012.<mask>Chinese authorities have not officially launched any space programs since 1978, and most of the work will focus on aerospace, defense and energy sectors.<mask>For the opening of a new center in the city of Nanjing in 2013, Chinese scientists are aiming to start building and manufacturing space stations and launching spacewalks for exploration.<mask>Read more : SpaceX is a key space milestone for China.<mask>The country's new space center will be called Shenzhou - 9, a collaboration between the United States and <p6> ( CNPC ) -- one of China's most advanced aerospace companies and a partnership company.<mask>With the space program being supported by private and government alliances and private investors, it's clear that Chinese space access is increasing in importance, says <p0>.<mask>" As a private company in China, we are seeing a lot of research and development opportunities in China," says <p1>, director of aerospace and defense at <p7>.<mask> <p9>, <p6> principal and founder, says the Chinese government wants to develop and develop the space station, which he calls China's largest private and private space enterprise.<mask> <p10>, director for research and production at the private company <p11>, says China is " committed to the exploration of international space centers and the development of other global cities."<mask> <p1> says Chinese companies are also involved in providing funding, but not working on their own yet.
<mask>For the most part, the chaotic response is in stark contrast to the images that emerged Sunday as Japanese troops battled Chinese troops in Okinawa, Japan's third - largest city, during a massive war with the Chinese government in the past month.<mask>Prime Minister <p0>, appearing in a closed - circuit television station, praised the Japanese troops, calling them a " great honor."<mask>But for his part, he defended the actions of the U. S. troops deployed in Japan.<mask>" They were not at the center of what I was trying to tell them, and it was difficult to tell."<mask>He vowed the United States " would respect and support our territorial integrity."<mask>Japan has accused China of provoking what he called a " barbaric " assault on its embassy.<mask>An estimated 150, 000 people packed Tokyo's central business district Sunday.<mask>The fighting between troops and demonstrators in the city's center and surrounding area left the center and a dozen journalists injured.<mask> <p2> said dozens of people remained at the scene, including one in critical condition.<mask>And the front - page news story went dark about Japan's military presence.<mask>Military spokesman <p3> told reporters that the situation was " still under control and I think we will continue to have a clear picture of the situation."<mask> <p0>, who has seen a lot of images of violence, said he's never seen any violence in the Japanese war against the Chinese, a fact that <p4> has been " deeply engaged in," <p3> said.<mask>But Japanese officials have denied accusations of excessive military involvement.<mask>At the scene Sunday, <p2> said the troops " are not in Japan " and that " what is causing this conflict has to be resolved."<mask> <p5> say the incident is an isolated incident, not a high - level one, though he has called it a terrorist attack.
<mask>Dr. <p0>, who had been treating patients suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder, said he was aware of her request for information.<mask>But even when he got to a meeting with the <p1> family on Sunday -- before she died -- he didn't think she would be able to sit next to him.<mask>" If she didn't see me, she wouldn't be here," <p0> said.<mask>"' Krystle, I don't think we're going to meet you.'<mask> <p3>'s still the most comforting thing for her."<mask> <p2> is one of two people slain during the two - day attack on the city that followed the 2013 race.<mask>The others were <p4> and <p5>.<mask> <p4> died as a result of the attack, which has rocked the Boston area.<mask> <p3>, 26, and <p4>'s mother, <p6>, died days after the explosion, which took place on the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.<mask> <p2> was just 15 months old when the bombs went off.<mask>Her mother died of her injuries ; <p6> was 20 years old.<mask>As the nurses walked to the hospital Sunday, <p2> received the chance to talk with her two daughters, ages 11 and 15.<mask>She received the first of several e - mails and texts.<mask>They talked about the hospital, the hospital and the Boston Marathon bombings.<mask>While she was on the scene Sunday, she called her sister's mother to say she was at the hospital with her husband.

<mask> <p0> had been widely tipped to replace the experienced <p1>, whose job was ruined by a bad run and a poor run.<mask>But following his resignation, <p3> confirmed that the 49 - year - old will now step down as coach of the French team.<mask>The <p1> were beaten 3 - 0 by Denmark in the group stage, but have endured a run of form which has seen them finish second in the French league this season with six points from their opening five games.<mask>They will return home to France at the start of the competition in Cape Town on January 13.<mask> <p0> was booed by the home fans at the quarterfinal defeat to Denmark, who won in the tournament in 1994.<mask>He made seven changes to the squad on Friday, and he is still in France.<mask> <p1> told French television : " This is my decision to step down.<mask> <p4> is not important and we will talk to the players again and we have to wait until we decide."<mask> <p7> took over after the collapse of Spain's 2009 World Cup campaign, but he will be replaced by former France international <p8>.<mask>" Laurent Blanc has been a mentor to me and will do everything possible to improve my team," <p4> said in a statement.<mask> <p6> has been the French coach since 1994 and was first elected by French president <p9> in 2001.<mask>Under his stewardship, the team won the European Championships with five different countries and reached the semifinals three times.<mask>In a sign of the club's financial woes, the Dutch have been punished by their own fans with an " anti - doping " trial since the tournament began, with <p6>, now <p1>'s deputy, going on a four - match suspension.<mask>France, who lost to England in the first round, were then stripped of all of their European and World Cups glory.<mask>As well as losing to Ireland, <p4> was also involved in the build - up to the 2012 tournament, which hosts the United States in Rio de Janeiro on June 14.
<mask>A <p0> side had come into their opponents'clash trailing 3 - 0 at halftime, but the Blues were quick to capitalize on <p1>'s earlier virtuoso free - kick to make it 3 - 2 in the 72nd minute.<mask>Fabregas'penalty and some post - match off - court aggression gave way to the Spanish side's trademark flowing flowing football and inspired many moments throughout the contest.<mask> <p0> striker <p2> scored a delightful second goal, his 22nd goal in 41 games for the Spanish giants, but he was left frustrated by Barcelona's persistence and inability to make an impact.<mask>" The referee was only about to say things to me, but I'm not here to criticize him for that," Barcelona coach <p7> told reporters.<mask>He added : " The referee didn't see it that way because it was just a tactical match, but it's always a tactical battle.<mask> <p2>'s team have been in fantastic form and we have shown that throughout the first 30 minutes of the second half we had the chances to equalize, but they are not capable of doing that.<mask>We are the favorites for the title.<mask> <p1> and Barca have always proved dangerous, but today's team played a very important match at the highest level.<mask>They proved as determined as ever to overcome us in the Nou Camp."<mask>Earlier, <p10> continued his superb start to this season by playing <p11> in the semifinals for the first time, and then <p12> in the second leg on Tuesday.<mask>The England striker was involved in the first leg of the quarterfinals in 2009 after replacing the injured <p1> at the Nou.<mask> <p4>, who lost to <p3> in last year's quarterfinals, is widely expected to be named <p13> favorite for the trophy following the Italian's injury - time exit.<mask>However, <p2> is unlikely to be an automatic finalist after the 26 - year - old went out against his former club with an injury in training.<mask>It took just 20 minutes for <p1> to break the deadlock, as his shot came close to going past <p0> goalkeeper <p14>.<mask>His compatriot <p12>, who also has a leg injury, showed his quality with a superb left - foot shot in the 34th minute that eluded <p2>.

<mask> <p0> says his resignation would be temporary and " no further action will be taken."<mask>He had been in office since 2001 and had been chief of staff for 17 years.<mask>His resignation letter, which was signed by 228 staff, authorizes him to remain in the post pending " administrative leave," and urges " no other permanent employee to take advantage of [ <p1>'s ] full administrative leave."<mask>The <p1> said <p0>, who has been in his second stint as hurricane center director since 2006, was " counseled, counseled and offered advice on effective exit and continued his work."<mask> <p7> of the petition noted <p0>'s resignation " did not reflect his professional experience, dedication, and professional commitment."<mask>A <p8> spokesman, <p9>, also declined to comment on the petition.<mask>But <p0> said in a statement Monday that " I am pleased that so many of my colleagues and most of the <p1> staff feel that it is time for my leadership to be taken seriously and appropriately."<mask>" The president has directed the NHC to conduct a thorough review of its operations in the next few weeks," he said.<mask>The hurricane center's director, <p5>, said Sunday that he believed that <p0> had done " his job " by leading a review of Hurricane Center management, even as the agency has not " done anything wrong."<mask> <p9> said that <p5> had also been " counsel advised " on how best to lead hurricane management, but he declined to elaborate on how or why <p0> was involved.<mask>" That said, my opinion that the process in which the NC has come to this point is very informal," he added.<mask> <p2> said Monday that <p1> has no plans to fire <p0> and " there are no plans on any other options."<mask>Meanwhile, <p0> has been named as interim <p1> director for the hurricane center.<mask>He was named permanent head of <p10> at the end of February, but the position has become vacant because of the death of a former hurricane center employee.<mask>Since his death, the staff has issued statements expressing dissatisfaction with the way the agency handled Hurricane Center's management, with some expressing disappointment in the way it handled the case.
<mask>But it's a job harder than ever.<mask> <p0> and <p1>, two South Korean photographers and videographers, share a passion for sharing their images, helping shape opinions about what's right and what isn't.<mask>" The images are our heart," they say.<mask>The passion is powerful, but there is a darker side to their work -- that's what's happening in Africa and around the world.<mask>It's a problem <p0>, one of three <p1> brothers working with <p1> at <p2>, says he's worried about what his brother's doing next.<mask>He says he is taking his phone out of his pocket as he fights back tears.<mask> <p2> officials are trying to determine if his brother has been targeted by the government.<mask>In an effort to stem the tide of violence in the region, the group is launching its first satellite imagery production in Africa.<mask>They also hope to take in the footage captured in Syria, Iraq and Libya.<mask>Last week, the organization released <p8>," a document detailing the group's work on <p9>, Africa's most - wanted terror suspects.<mask>E - mail to a friend.
<mask>You may well be wondering if you have a personal device that contains a lot of personal information, such as e - mail addresses, phone numbers, <p0> and banking information.<mask>It is not surprising that many mobile phone companies have been drawn to mobile phone applications, and some even say that smartphones contain enough data to fill an entire entire large - scale database.<mask>However, the fact that we have a mobile phone operating system which stores everything from credit card details to payment information, is not the same for everyone.<mask> <p2>'s mobile phone has so far not given any details in its application.<mask>But a new <p0> device, the Galaxy Gear, contains a broad range of mobile phone apps that could theoretically change how much information you can have about your mobile phone.<mask>The Gear would also feature a big database of phone numbers and phone numbers.<mask> <p0>'s phone is a " feature phone " and users can download any information they want, including credit card numbers and the length of time someone uses it.<mask>They can also download any mobile information from the device, from a phone's camera to the <p0> card or on to a tablet computer.<mask>Although <p0> has yet to give any details on its software, it is likely that the new <p1> is the first of several mobile phones to have that capability.<mask>Last year, a similar device, called the Galaxy S4, released the same feature phone software that gives mobile phone users the ability to download movies and music on their phones.<mask> <p7> are a popular voice - activated feature which could include audio and video on their phone and text messaging on the mobile phone, but it has not been released.<mask>This is what distinguishes a mobile phones from <p1> in that users are increasingly likely to use them to access the vast contents of their phones, with <p8> mobile phone running the Android 3. 0 operating system.<mask>For example, a mobile handset has a camera mounted on its dock and allows users to display and share the information they have on their mobile phone screen.<mask>Even though people have many different phones with cameras, this system has not given the services they need to do it.
<mask>I spent some time with a young Norwegian man who wrote letters to Pope <p0> asking for his permission for him to continue in his reign as spiritual leader.<mask>And yet, for over three centuries, he has remained largely shrouded in secrecy -- shrouded in mystery.<mask>The secret behind the secrecy, says Norwegian newspaper <p1>, is " a hidden theology of the human spirit, that keeps us all waiting to witness the natural world itself unfold."<mask>So while I might have a peek at the hidden behind the closed chimney by chance, this was what <p2> chose to do last week as Pope <p3>'s " Dear Leader."<mask>In an interview with <p1>'s <p4>, Pope <p5> says Pope <p2>'s decree will be published later this year on <p6> website.<mask>As to his Vatican experience, he declined to speak publicly about Pope <p1>.<mask>But I have received letters and notes asking for my help in finding the right words and images for his new book, " The Secret Pope Emeritus."<mask> <p6> is a Holocaust memorial in Rome.<mask>It is a collection of letters to be added as part of his official journal.<mask>His first book is about the history of the Jewish church and is scheduled to be published next week.<mask> <p7> of Israel told <p8> that the pope's " peculiar " desire for a private Jewish center has been " quite surprising " and is " absolutely " irresistible.<mask>He's often been quoted as saying that the need for a synagogue is understandable since he wants <p3> to " feel that he needs his Jewish center."<mask>But it wasn't his desire to see a private synagogue, he says, or his desire that " the Jewish center be preserved for people to know the true nature of life."<mask>" The secrecy that surrounds the Vatican City in all aspects of the religious rituals -- the secrecy about the church and its inhabitants, the secrecy regarding who is allowed to attend the ceremonies -- is also peculiar, he said.<mask> <p10>.
<mask>Former first lady <p0> was pleased with the surgery, Dr. <p1> said.<mask>" We're pleased with how <p2> is doing and is responding well to treatment," Dr. Dr.<mask> <p0> told <p3>.<mask>The surgery had been performed at the Bush UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after doctors repaired and seal the ulcer and graft aorta into her stomach.<mask> <p6>, 41, is the fourth U.

<mask> <p0> government's purchase of <p1>.<mask>As <p1> was leaving his home in Guyana, the company's general manager asked his staff to pick up <p2>, which he said had recently been illegally purchased.<mask> <p1>, who owns <p3>, had been working with <p2> on issues with her government and had requested a different corporate structure.<mask>" I was told by our marketing company that this was going to be a problem and we needed to make sure that <p0> was fully prepared for what the government was going for," <p4>, senior vice president of <p5>, said Monday.<mask>She would not disclose details of the purchase.<mask>The company was already under contract with the government's civil engineering division.<mask>According to the company, <p1>'s coatings had been put on hold while the government investigated whether the coatings should be considered as a possible crime.<mask> <p3> is a natural color found in <p6> green tea leaves, according to <p7>, a spokeswoman for <p8>.<mask>However, she says, after the police investigation, there were no reports of any crime associated with the coations.<mask> <p7> told <p9> the coatcases have since been returned to <p2>.<mask>He said his company had been told that the coatage was safe.<mask> <p4> said he has been told the coatages were being shipped to the church and he believes the church is ready to accept the change.<mask>Watch an engineer tell how the coat came into his possession ».<mask>An investigation into the coatks found some inconsistencies in the design.<mask>Officials do not know whether the jacket was improperly purchased.
<mask> <p0> said Thursday.<mask>He said it's not clear when the opening would take place but <p1>, the federal agency responsible for overseeing the massive floodway, told reporters in Baton Rouge.<mask>Louisiana Gov.<mask> <p5> has said he expects the Mississippi River to be open as early as Saturday.<mask>The plan to open the massive canal, which feeds into the Mississippi, is in the final stages of building the Morganza Spillway, which is estimated to be the country's largest structure and the country most populous.<mask> <p0> also said he plans to direct the <p1> underground for " the first time since the Morganina Spillgway opened."<mask>Officials say the goal of the plan is to stop the flow of floodwater -- the heaviest in nearly half a century -- that will flood the Gulf Coast during the 2011 Mississippi River flood.<mask>It's not yet clear when it will happen, <p0> said, adding that the decision on opening the floodway will be made on May 18.<mask>" We will make sure that we have no stone in the sand in our hands that this won't happen," <p0> told reporters.<mask>Earlier in the day, the Coastal Alabama Spillgenway closed on October 19 because of a flood.
<mask>Congolese midfielder <p0> scored a late equalizer to give <p1> a 1 - 1 draw on Wednesday night.<mask> <p1> coach <p2> was delighted to see his club progress through to the final at a historic time, but warned that the South Americans would have to wait for a miracle before they can take on the second - placed teams from his country.<mask>" Internacional deserved this," he told <p3>.<mask>But as the match was over, however, a crowd of over 80, 000 gathered in the streets of the Brazilian capital to watch the team play in a glittering final.<mask>It was a fitting end to a year marked by controversy over <p4> corruption allegations and allegations of graft in soccer -- the subject of probes from the U. S. into alleged corruption.<mask>On a night of intense controversy, <p5> was awarded a $ 40, 000 bonus after being found guilty of embezzling $ 16, 800 following an investigation into a corruption scandal.<mask> <p7> had claimed the money was directed towards his club and a number of African football's ruling body <p8> were angry at his counterpart for his handling of the case.<mask> <p5> appealed the decision, but the <p9>'s ruling was upheld by a lower court last month.<mask> <p6> also issued a statement welcoming the win and expressing its " gratitude to <p2> and the entire Congolese footballing community for this important victory.<mask>The final is expected to be attended to by both <p5> and <p1> members."<mask> <p9>, the <p8> secretary general, called for a " special " time for African football after his team successfully defended against the likes of <p10> and Corinthians in South Africa.<mask> <p12>'s <p13> and <p14> were also sent off for incidents which have seen matches disrupted.<mask> <p16> ( CAF ) and CSKA Sofia ( CSKA ) were also fined $ 80, 250 for racist comments during their 3 - 1 defeat by French champions Paris Saint - Germain.
<mask>Just a few weeks ago, during a congressional hearing on health care, he was forced to explain his position on <p0>.<mask>He said the legislation that he supported would only allow the government to give a special tax credit to businesses, including banks, for doing business in the U. S.<mask>But <p0> has been very adamant that it doesn't do any good.<mask>The president now faces a clear choice, even though <p1> says, " It is right to use the power of law to advance my agenda."<mask>On Tuesday, <p4> will vote on whether to extend a special credit for banks that could contribute to <p0>'s success.<mask>Although <p5> is a government agency which has already extended its credit and banks, <p2> is now able to take advantage of the new <p0> credit and expand it.<mask> <p8> and federal credit cards will be expanded.<mask> <p2> can also create more and more credit without having to give more to banks that provide credit and credit.<mask>This means that unless the economy goes through the other way, the new credit can take away credit.

<mask> <p0>, which are designed to prevent children from developing heart attacks and stroke, " should not be used as a shield for children as long as there is a reasonable chance of safe transportation for children and teens," according to <p1>.<mask> <p1> officials said the devices are part of <p2>, an initiative intended to reduce children's risk of developing heart disease in vehicles, but the devices " pose an increasing threat to children, teens and other vulnerable children who are in their 70s and older."<mask>" An increasing number of teens and teens are taking action to lessen their risk of heart disease, stroke and developmental disabilities by using the devices as a masking system," <p1> said in a statement.<mask>" Our goal is to prevent the death and injury caused by unsafe parked cars and similar technologies."<mask>Last summer, <p4> in Jackson, Mississippi, issued an emergency report on how to safely parked cars without a mask.<mask> <p6>, which was developed by researchers at <p7>, and <p8> ( <p9> ) spent several years testing the devices before launching a voluntary program of portable devices.<mask>They were not available in 2011.<mask> <p4> and <p9> have both said they will continue to develop the devices and will continue working on new and affordable vehicles, while the government has urged them to remain in operation.

<mask>Designed by architect <p0>, the cathedral will house two magnificent paintings, one of which has more than 200 original stories and the other, enormous sculpture, which is intended to inspire worshipers.<mask> <p1> say the design will inspire the spirit of worship that still exists in the cathedral.<mask>" The cathedral is a new religion in the 21st century and I think we are going to create something that will inspire worship in an entirely new way," <p1>, who designed the work, told <p2>.<mask>What started as a project of construction and demolition, has evolved into a much bigger project and is now being used as a permanent exhibition building for the university.<mask>The university began construction on the cathedral in September, just after the disaster of the earthquake that struck central Japan.<mask>A panel was formed to provide a platform for the exhibition, which will culminate in a series of exhibits at <p6> in October.<mask>Other exhibits, designed by <p4>, include a restored 15th - century window into <p7>, an interactive map of <p8> and a reconstruction of <p9>, which collapsed in a magnitude - 7. 0 earthquake.<mask> <p8> is the original design of the cathedral, built in <p10> in 1886.<mask>It is still active, although it was torn down in 1999.<mask> <p6> is one of only two institutions that has survived the devastating quake, and it was built by <p11>, who has been a respected architect of the building.<mask>He also has worked on a museum and library in the center, which also features more than 100 original works.<mask>For <p0> and others who live in New York, the work has taken on another identity : <p12>, a 17th - generation muralist and composer who's also an architect.<mask> <p4> told <p3> he was honored to have been involved in the project, which he said has received a " tremendous amount of support " from the government, <p13> and other stakeholders.<mask>But <p4> said he feels " strongly committed " to the work.<mask>Since the earthquake, the group has been working with local churches and artists to establish the cathedral's original building, which measures 12 feet by 12 feet.

<mask>The voter ID law in Texas requires all forms of identification at all major public polling stations.<mask>In a 3 - 2 ruling, the justices said they concluded such requirements were necessary to proceed with the law's constitutionality.<mask>" A Texas court of appeals in this case concluded that Texas law defies its provisions and the standards for Texas law, and that it is not a violation of the fundamental due process rights of Texas citizens," Chief Justice <p4> wrote for the majority.<mask>The law is known as the <p0>, and was passed with the intention of expanding voting rights.<mask>Oral arguments are scheduled for April.<mask>At issue is whether it is necessary to provide a driver's license, the primary document required to vote and a photo identification, or to present an alternative voter ID, which is required under the law to vote.<mask>A federal appeals court later ruled that the law, which was originally supposed to be enacted in October, would not proceed.<mask>Abbott appealed the high court's order to temporarily block enforcement of the law.<mask> <p0> officials say they have been under pressure from <p5> to stop enforcement of voter identification laws.<mask>It had been considered a federal law by Texas officials to prevent voter fraud, and it had challenged the law as discriminatory.<mask> <p5> challenged it in federal court, saying it could no longer apply to all voter registration laws in the state.<mask>Texas officials then took the matter to federal court for review.<mask> <p10> in 2008 upheld a 2008 voter identification law, but the high - profile case involved the challenged law's enforcement and the challenged voting rights provisions.<mask> <p2> was the plaintiff in that case.<mask>She claimed the law violated her right to vote when she refused to give a birth certificate that would help in making her 2004 vote.

<mask>But when he saw the doctor's note, it was different.<mask>" He's a weak guy.<mask>He's wearing only a few pieces.<mask>You can't see the bone in his face.<mask>That's why he wasn't there.<mask>I saw him in a hospital -- a <p0> clinic.<mask>What I did was tell him he couldn't walk.<mask>But that was it.<mask>They showed him his scars.<mask>Even though he was weak, he was able to speak Spanish.<mask>His voice was strong.<mask>And despite his weak frame, he had the dignity and charisma to make a convincing case against the United States.<mask>In a country that is known for its low fertility rates, in this case, it couldn't be higher.<mask>So in fact, Salvador -- known simply as " El Salvador " -- escaped from Guatemala with the help of two brothers.<mask>After years on the lam, El Salvador began his odyssey on foot from Guatemala, eventually making it to the U.

<mask> <p0> emerged as a top official at the <p1> after prosecutors in New York charged him with sexual assault.<mask> <p2> : Prosecutor in France wants to see <p0> charged.<mask> <p4>, in a statement, said <p0> deserved to be tried for aggravated rape.<mask> <p3>, a member of the <p5>'s powerful advisory body, said the charge " undermines <p0>'s moral authority and it should send a strong message to those who commit sexual crimes."<mask>The allegations are the latest in a long - running controversy involving the world's most powerful official.<mask>Some French people, including some young women, have spoken out since the <p4> case became public, calling it a " lynching."<mask>A few people also have said they are " outraged " at the development.<mask> <p7>, a French politician, said he believes that the charges are politically motivated and will be taken into consideration by a French court if the case goes ahead.<mask>" If the story is true and I do not believe it, it will be a rush to judgment," he told <p8>.<mask>But he said the charges against him would be different than the rape accusation against the Belgian economist.<mask>Police in France say they have arrested more than 300 people since the alleged rape took place in New Jersey more than a decade ago.<mask>While the charges carry up to life in prison, prosecutors in France have said the statute of limitations has run out, prompting them to charge the remaining suspects with sexual misconduct.<mask>Many in France felt the charges were politically motivated, and their reactions in recent days have been mixed.<mask>One in <p7> told <p9>, " In France, the justice system is broken, and this is not true."<mask>It is not unusual for people to express resentment over the accusations against the Blais - Kahn chief and his aides, who are suspected of having sexually assaulted him in a hotel room in New Orleans in 2011, <p1> said in a news release.
<mask>The task force's advice is not as clear as it seems ; this is why the first guideline was " not included in the new list of recommendatory measures."<mask>Dr. <p5>, a pediatrician, agrees : " There is a strong scientific reason to recommend screening for lung cancer.<mask>The first guideline recommends screening for very few diseases."<mask>The new guidance, announced last August by the <p3>, is merely the latest paper to emerge on the fight against lung cancer that includes short and moderate life - threatening lung cancer and other lung cancer issues.<mask>In some cases, the rule does not apply to lung cancer patients because the practice is not linked to many deaths, but to tumors and other diseases.<mask>For example, lung cancer may be spread through a person's blood vessels, and may not spread through the lungs, or that person may have a disease that is spread through your body through direct contact with your organs.<mask> <p0>, however, are different.<mask>Studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.<mask>These studies have not shown that treatment for lung cancers ( specifically <p1>, <p1> and <p6> ) can reduce the chance of lung cancer spread and the potential death from lung cancer, which can be fatal if left untreated.<mask>To combat this, the task force created a new research call for the <p7> and <p8> to consult with health care professionals about the recommendations.<mask>We also have a recommendation that the <p6> screen for lung, in combination with screening for other lung - related diseases, will cut off the cancer - associated lung cancer gene altogether and reduce the risk of lung lung cancer mutating to be fatal.<mask>At the same time, the aut panel is recommending that people stop smoking -- a practice the <p9> has called " lung cancer fatigue and associated lung disease."<mask>As the task Force says, lung screening will increase the chance that there will be severe lung cancer - related liver damage, as well as fewer likely lung cancers and chronic bronchial diseases.

<mask>The country is grappling with the possibility of a race boycott of the 2011 season following allegations of race - fixing by track operators.<mask>Despite a reduction in the number of spectators and spectators, <p0>, motorsport's executive director of global travel, told <p1> that there would still be a lot of problems to solve.<mask>" It's a challenge to get enough people to come into India, especially in the eastern part of the country, and we've seen over the last two years the problem," said <p2>, who is heading the India branch of <p3>'s global governing body for sport.<mask>But he warned that despite the lack of investment, there are already concerns that race drivers are being held liable for a spike in violence.<mask> <p2> said the number would likely climb as the number increases.<mask> <p6> in the Indian capital of New Delhi last week, <p7> ( FMS ) said there are no guarantees race drivers would be allowed to race in Indian cities due to safety concerns.<mask>The track has been the subject of controversy following its track safety measures were introduced to protect the safety of spectators following the closure of the circuit in February.<mask>That move angered F1 officials, who say any safety measures such as red flags or extra safety drills will be enforced to ensure safety in the race track.<mask>It is an issue which <p2> told <p8>, " It's not just the safety measures that have been proposed and I think some people are concerned."<mask>" The safety measures on the track are also being taken in order to get a more reliable level of safety," added <p0>.<mask>There have been numerous allegations of racial and ethnic discrimination in recent years with F1's Indian Grand Prix barred from being held in India despite the color of the skin of its flag.<mask>However, the controversy over race venue safety was raised last week after <p6>, which was not invited to race at the 2010 race, issued a report.<mask> <p5>, one of F1 motorsport experts, said the concerns about race safety were over the lack sufficient resources to adequately protect the Indian flag.

<mask>But it's not enough to get us to a point where it doesn't matter whether we actually believe the science.<mask>It's time to change the equation, <p1> said.<mask>When it comes to climate change, the answer has always been no.<mask>That changed with <p1> and the world's first scientist, <p2>, who on Friday announced the results of the latest IPCC report on global warming.<mask>He told <p3> they're " optimistic that we can change our climate."<mask>Their conclusion is, quite simply, stunning.<mask>Despite the best efforts of the authors and authors, the " silver bullet " has failed in capturing our attention and steering us toward a reality of global warming that will require massive action.<mask> <p4> and <p5> have made it clear that the world will not be able to deal with these dire realities without taking action.
<mask>The arrests followed Egypt's military - led arrests Sunday of two <p0> journalists, two <p1> journalists and a fellow <p2> correspondent.<mask>The government issued a statement saying it was trying to find the missing journalists, who it said had been " involved in illegal activities."<mask>" The government wants to free the four and discuss their case with the world's media organizations, but there is no proof that they were part of any illegal activities, and the media organizations are now seeking to smear the government," said the <p3>'s director - general, <p4>.<mask> <p2>, the official news agency, said the four journalists were arrested " as part of the <p1>'s political campaign."<mask> <p4> declined to comment further on the arrest, which comes amid tensions in the Middle East.<mask>A separate string of arrests have also been reported in Egypt.<mask> <p5>, a <p0> producer, was detained Saturday in a Cairo suburb after the country's interior ministry accused him of covering up unrest.<mask>In March, Egyptian police fired on protesters, killing one person and wounding seven, according to state media.<mask>Egypt's <p3> suspended operations at Cairo's <p6>, <p7> and <p8> stations, saying " there is a high risk of further unrest and torture."<mask>The suspension is in effect until September 25.<mask> <p4> said the suspension would apply to the media company and its affiliated companies.<mask>" We strongly advise the company to respect local governments and the rights of the media under the law and avoid any interference in the internal affairs of the organizations that work for them," the statement said.<mask>And the government has charged that the network is spreading false information about Egypt, which " is a serious problem in the Muslim Brotherhood's view."<mask> <p2> was one of the most prominent anchors of Egyptian television.<mask>It was its first station to be shut down in the country since 1989, and later dropped from the network amid widespread unrest.
<mask> <p0> officials last month launched a purge of Florida voters from their voter rolls in a bid to suppress President <p1>'s re - election, a move that has rankled political groups and prompted <p2> to urge the government to investigate.<mask> <p3> Secretary <p4> said Tuesday that <p5> will be providing access to the nation's voter databases, and Florida Secretary of <p6> <p7> said the information will be made available to <p5> when it releases its final results.<mask>" We are pleased to have access to these databases and we are actively supporting the administration's efforts to ensure Florida voters will cast their ballots as they deserve, regardless of their circumstances," Perez said in a statement.<mask>Florida officials and <p2> officials had been at odds over a series of issues on the voter rolls during the 2012 election.<mask> <p5> used purge requests to suppress <p1> re - elections, the latest to include denial of citizenship.<mask>In May, <p0> officials said they had begun a purge process and had hoped to get as many as 200, 000 non - citizens registered to vote.<mask>The purge has been supported by some groups, but opponents say it amounts to a blatant ploy to disenfranchise minority voters.<mask> <p0> said it is working with the <p8>, <p9> and <p10>, which asked Florida officials to provide their data on those types of voter registration requests to the Florida secretary of state.<mask> <p6> said the documents, which were released Tuesday by <p11>, also will address those irregularities in Florida's election, among other things.<mask>However, he said <p3> had not given the documents to the <p9>, a state law enforcement organization that monitors voter registration information.<mask>Officials from the <p12>, <p13> and <p14> said the effort was " designed to suppress votes that are not counted and will never be counted."<mask>The election officials would not comment on specific election data.<mask>But <p6> said it was a " proactive effort."<mask>" I know we have the resources of <p5> and <p9>," <p6> spokesman <p15> said.<mask>While it wasn't immediately clear whether <p6> would follow the lead of <p4>, a Republican senator who has argued voter registration efforts will be a good way to see the number of eligible voters on voting rolls.
<mask>It's been two years since <p0> of Cleveland, Ohio, and <p1> of Atlanta, Georgia, started out as a bug catcher in a bug - infested house at home.<mask>They've since evolved into an extension of their arsenal of bug - repellent to help stay out of danger.<mask>What's not to love about bug bites?<mask>When you're trying to protect your family from unwanted invaders, you're thinking about mosquitoes.<mask>And now we want to protect you.<mask>W bugs : Your guide.<mask>As a bug expert and mother of two, I've spent countless weeks studying the parasites that infect, produce and spread bugs in my house, and I recently visited a new lab working with experts to develop bug repellents for kids in their home. The main goal of <p3> is to develop " a new type of repellant that is in the insect repellance that will help protect you against these bugs, insects, and other insects," <p4> said.<mask>It worked with the museum and the kids, who are learning the bugs'relatives, to develop the repellency for bugs.<mask>Now <p1> and <p0> are using the latest techniques in their new lab to develop repellants for a few weeks to keep kids safe and healthy.<mask>But, don't be alarmed : We'll be sending in a photo and a video ( courtesy of mom. com ) to see how the bugs are doing.<mask>You'll find the full range of bugs ( including one species called <p5> ) in the laboratory.<mask>Here are five sneaky bugs that are doing more than hiding behind a house.<mask>We've already tested bugs as we know it :.<mask>-- B - B - C types : The larvae of mice, cornstarch monkeys, and a host of other bugs.

<mask>With " 100th " airing Sunday, fans of the iconic TV series are more likely to find themselves on the road to earning a reprieve for the remainder of the season.<mask>That's why <p0>, <p1> and <p2> are pushing for a network to capitalize on the network's massive longevity.<mask>" That's why the network has been so keen to continue to produce shows about scripted scripted shows," <p1> said.<mask> <p2>'s syndication strategy is a risky one.<mask>With eight ratings in the past year alone, " 100 " has made it past those 10 - episode mark, thereby ensuring a network is taking its act and its characters on the fast track.<mask>The original " 100," which first aired in 1976 on the <p3> network, starred <p4> and <p5> as the titular two - time <p6> A - lister.<mask> <p4> played the boss of a drug cartel that runs the government.<mask> <p3>'s version of the show ran on the same network for nine seasons -- six in a row and eight in a two - week span.<mask>In 2007, it won a best drama <p3> for the third straight year.<mask>Its ratings were up 21 percent, said <p8>, a TV critic with <p9>.<mask>Last season, " 10," a four - hour marathon that ran for five hours and 10 minutes, also went for a ratings bump.<mask>But with the addition of <p4>, the audience grew.<mask> <p5>, who was also on " 100 : A Space Odyssey " and <p6> " <p10>," was " much more popular " in 2007, <p8> said.
<mask>Cars sit parked behind us, waiting for impatient technicians to come to the clinic.<mask>Patients hurry past them to get a procedure.<mask>Sharing frustration and frustration, some staff complain they don't have the resources to work in the $ 2. 8 million facility, where many patients wait long hours for a procedure or extra clinic fees.<mask> <p0> are demanding $ 2 million for the clinic to provide care in Myanmar.<mask>The price of medicine for Myanmar is more than double its U.

<mask>The Italian health care consultant, whose recent hospitalization has led to her death at age 61, has been treating the health ailment for the last four months, despite having to have seen a number of strokes and the need for a ventilator.<mask>" It's hard to tell when it comes to the next cycle of dying," said <p0>, adding that her doctors'assistants were concerned she would be slipping into a spiral of depression.<mask> <p0> -- known by the Italian media as <p1> -- was born and raised in <p2>, a small town near Naples, Italy, in 1951 and worked in the garden and in a yard during the late 1980s.<mask>She was a registered nurse at <p3>.<mask>Around the same time, she started learning how to manage a garden hose and her mother passed away, leaving her for only two months to attend her younger brother's funeral.<mask>While her mother did her best to try and stem the growing tide of infections, Pirlo was unable to find her more effective treatment.<mask>So she decided to take her mother on a two - month trip to the country.<mask>It was an easy choice given the limited time to visit her mother.<mask>This time, <p0>'s daughter, <p4>, is due in the U. S. for a post - primary clinic on Thursday.<mask>The trip was to aid her older sister and her family in their rehabilitation in Florida.<mask> <p2>'s health declined during the trip, but by the end of the week, it had become clear the hospital was in the " very good " situation.<mask> <p1> and her husband were working on the IV drip system in an attempt to treat the worsening condition.<mask>They received a visit from a doctor who said they had no symptoms and could not give her anyages -- they needed to continue the IV drips for another eight months.<mask>Their plan is to use the drips to create a special drip line for the day to provide a nutrition supplement.<mask>With the help of the internet and the power of social media, " We have devised a way for each of us to give a little bit more attention to our health problems," said Dr. <p0>.
<mask> <p0>, who plays for Russia, invaded the courts in the men's final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow and had to return to court after the ruling was issued.<mask>" <p0> made a reference to a group of competitors which are currently sitting on courts, which does not meet the level of competition on court and has not heard of the incident," London's <p1> said.<mask>The 26 - year - old reacted with fury, throwing the offending poster at the judges.<mask>A statement on <p1>'s official website read : " The first official incident of a tennis match is regrettable and we hope it will prompt an independent review of all aspects of the game.<mask> <p1> takes the issue seriously."<mask> <p2> spokesman <p3> released a statement condemning the incident.<mask>He said : " We are extremely disappointed that we have to issue an injunction at this time to prevent <p4> from contesting the <p5> semifinal.<mask>We are also cooperating fully with the police and they are continuing their investigation.<mask> <p2> will be providing information to police during the course of their investigation."<mask>It's the second time in less than a week that Nalbandian has made headlines.<mask>In July he was handed an eight - match ban after punching and kicking Australian teenager <p3>, leaving him on the ground.<mask> <p0> was due to take the court in the women's draw for the second consecutive tournament, but after the incident he took to Twitter to apologize to the officials.<mask>And he did so on Sunday, in front of a section of the judges as the <p8> wrapped up a 6 - 3 6 - 4 win over Kazakhstan's <p9>.<mask>Nalbandia's behavior prompted the court's police chief to take over with immediate effect.<mask>After the incident, Nalbadian tweeted : " I'm sorry I was involved in this incident & its repercussions on me.
<mask>The lights, illuminated by a pair of giant LEDs that illuminate the city's Christmas tree, have been here in the past.<mask>Last year, <p1> -- a <p2>, Canada -- brought in an extra $ 600 million, and <p3> has since added another $ 700 million.<mask> <p3> -- which is part of Canada's largest arts and cultural center -- had just enough money to add a new light fixture to its collection.<mask>" We have a very, very good lighting display for Christmas," <p3> says.<mask>The LEDs were planted in October in the <p2>'s Kitchen section.<mask>This year, there are some 1, 400 lights -- or about half the lights that were planted three years ago.<mask> <p1>'s decor features eight giant, LED domes that resemble the dome of <p4> and a large, metallic cube that stands 2. 5 feet tall.<mask>It has the largest LED dome ever put in place and can be seen by the public.<mask>Another giant <p2> display has been in effect since May.<mask>At its peak, <p3> is getting more than 200 light bulbs, about 60 percent of the city standard LED bulbs.<mask>In addition to the traditional Christmas displays, the city is also providing a new street lighting system for its new hotels.<mask>Each year around 8, 000 people descend on the South Pole to enjoy the dazzling displays.<mask>Here are some of the best submissions.<mask>What do you think of the lights?<mask>Tell us what you think in the comments below.
<mask>It was just a couple of months ago that I would say goodbye to a glittering evening in San Francisco.<mask>The dust had come off my car.<mask>It had left a crater 3, 000 feet deep and, like a ghost, lay twisted in the dust.<mask>But then, when the dust hit the ground, I saw it was gone.<mask>After a month, my eyes re - opened and I saw the dust on the ground below.<mask> <p0> is no longer visible.<mask>I cannot see the smoldering remnants of what once stood before me.<mask>That has since been restored.<mask>On a street corner in San Jose, I was surprised by the dust that still stands on the sidewalks.<mask>My husband, who works for <p0>, said it was still dust when I first walked in the door to come back from the neighborhood.<mask>He had just returned from an operation in <p1>.<mask> <p1> had been a scene from a long film and had the most striking impression I have ever seen.<mask>As a photographer, it was something I'd never seen before.<mask>And so when I pulled up next to a sign that read " City of Angels," I was struck by the clear, white dust that filled the sky.<mask>What had seemed so much less important to me was the fact that people were not reacting to the dust at all.

<mask>It was a question I asked him at my dinner table, but he was more interested in exploring the causes behind chocolate consumption than helping consumers make informed decisions about their quality.<mask> <p0> is the name of the company behind the " Made in chocolate " campaign.<mask>Last month, <p2>, a cocoa farmer, became the company's principal cocoa consultant for cocoa and chocolate products.<mask> <p2> is also the name behind the campaign, which seeks chocolate - farmers to distribute goods to needy communities worldwide.<mask>In a country known for its low cocoa prices, <p0>'s chocolate business has created a new category in chocolate - producing countries.<mask>This category is based on the fact that <p0> -- a major cocoa producer -- has a higher cocoa - processing value than any other producer.<mask>A hectare is worth a minimum of 1. 5 metric tons of cocoa, enough to make the company worth $ 100 million.<mask>It is the world's largest producer of chocolate and remains a top cocoa producer despite the fact <p0> is made up of cocoa and cocoa beans.<mask>The company produces 40 % of the world cocoa.<mask> <p4>'s chocolate consumption is 40 % lower than the other four major chocolate producing nations, which accounts for nearly 1 % of cocoa production worldwide.

<mask>Who is <p0>?<mask> <p1>.<mask>The charismatic, politically savvy, and globally - renowned leader of the world's largest Sunni movement is his al - Baghdadi and his supporters have been calling him the emir of Iraq's second largest city, Baghdad.<mask>They say he has a track record as leader of <p2>, or <p3>, in Iraq.<mask> <p4> as the Islamic State, the group's name is the head of <p3>'s second - largest training camp, <p5> in Iraq, where he is believed to command some 2, 300 recruits.<mask>He is said to have traveled to Iraq in 2006.<mask>Most recently, he was reported to be hiding in Jordan, a place he had held for years.<mask>But in a statement released by <p1> on Tuesday, the leader called on " all parties involved " to keep their pledge to respect the Iraqi government, " as well as those who oppose ( it )."<mask>As the U. S. government tries to establish credibility with Iraq's government, the country has been hit hard by deadly fighting between U. N.- backed groups -- including the Sunni extremist group <p6>, which has launched a massive recruitment drive.<mask>As <p4>, the name is a reference to the number of Syrian refugees now living in the country, and it has been used to name former Syrian President <p7>, a <p6> figure, the Syrian equivalent of <p8>.<mask>There is no clear name for this man.<mask>In the West, <p8> is considered the most powerful of all his followers.<mask> <p8> was released from prison in April 2013 after being held for five years in Iraq and was released on $ 10 million bail.<mask>Since then, the U.- backed Iraqi government has been fighting and supporting groups that support Iraqis.<mask>This week, Iraq held a special election in the northern city of Mosul, bringing the group to a close with some Sunni fighters.
<mask>India's central government has implemented the strict restrictions on building and construction permits on its roads -- so roads, train lines and airports are not blocked.<mask>" This is a major problem for our cities," said <p10>, India's deputy finance minister.<mask>The bullet trains that cross the country every day pass through Mumbai's financial district every 24 hours, where many factories and buildings have sprung up.<mask>But the high cost of living in the city's financial center and industrial zone has made it difficult for authorities to control the numbers of people working on the roads.<mask>Officials say the cuts to Mumbai's roads and railway lines are largely due to a rise in inflation, but <p0> Minister <p11> told a <p12> panel that the measures are part of a larger strategy to curb the rate of growth.<mask>India has one of the world's most creaky roads, and the size of the Mumbai area has increased by 80 % in the past decade, <p0> said.<mask>However, with a decade left to run, Â £ 5. 3 billion ($ 6. 9 billion ) of government spending cuts are needed to meet rising demand, Now an economist with a London - based bank says Mumbai's infrastructure is a problem.<mask>In a recent <p5> poll India's growth rate averaged 0. 7 percent -- the lowest in the developed world.<mask> <p5> survey by <p13> last week found Mumbai's ratio to GDP had dropped 6. 5 percentage points in the last two months as a result of improvements in government spending, but by comparison the ratio is now at 3. 4 per cent.<mask>A total of 9. 7 billion people work in the capital city, and Mumbai is a big buyer of foreign direct investment.<mask> <p7>, India has made a bid to cut spending by $ 13 billion over the next decade.<mask> <p8> estimates it will cost about $ 6 billion to build a bridge on a proposed bridge between India's financial capital and neighboring Pakistan.<mask>That includes plans to construct a bridge over the river in Poonch district.<mask>E - mail to a friend.<mask> <p21> <p22>.

<mask>The Cavaliers are in the middle of an intense lockout, with owners -- including the current <p0> president <p1> -- accusing the <p2> of having a " very bad record " with stars such as <p3>, <p4> and <p5>.<mask>" I don't think there are a lot of guys who have great players who don't have great memories of playing for the <p3> and winning championships," <p1> said, referring to former <p6> players who sign with <p3> or <p7> before the end of the season.<mask> <p0> President <p1> : " The best team is in a position to make a lot more decisions on players, but I think if you start with something that we can make from scratch and then have an edge in this league, there's an edge to be on the edge in the playoffs," <p0> co - owner <p8> told <p9>.<mask> <p3>, who was in the <p0> media pack for Tuesday's Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals in Ohio, is a potential free agent - signing, as they seek to make the playoffs.<mask>He averaged 16 points and nine assists in his first four starts for <p2> last season and believes if the Cleveland team does not offer him a deal then he could be left with a team that doesn't like him.<mask> <p4>, in a letter to Cleveland General Manager <p10>, wrote : " At this moment, if you're trying to win your contract, you've got to play out of your mind -- it's not an option.<mask>It's not your job.<mask>As such, we will be here if you do offer your best and hope that the team does something."<mask>Cavaliers'fortunes have been damaged after James'death in a hotly contested court battle with James'former teammates.<mask>The <p2>'s previous four finals were against <p11>, the Orlando Magic and <p12>.<mask>However, the team, which has won championships in 17 of the past 19 years, is one of <p3>'s biggest rivals in the Eastern <p13>.<mask>In September, the <p6> said it would delay James'release in the second half of this season so that they could try to keep the 30 - year - old's contract up for another six seasons.<mask> <p1> acknowledged he had been frustrated with the way <p3> has dealt with players, such as Kobe Bryant, <p5> and <p14>, that <p15> have struggled.<mask>But the center added : " We've got a lot going on here, but obviously we
<mask>" When we go out into the high desert and we see the bays and ridges, it's hard to think of anything else that's so extreme," said <p0>, who works for a Utah - based company that's growing tall, sandbagged and canyons on the Grand Canyon.<mask>" But we do see bays."<mask>The company's CEO, <p3>, says the area is also a potential employer for the local government.<mask>In the past five years, Utah has produced 7, 000 tallies of tall, heavily protected tallies, about 2, 000 large bays, 350 ponds, 8, 000 streams and 18, 000 acres of desert.<mask>That is larger than <p4>'s tall <p5> tall and 200 - foot tall <p6> tall.<mask>But when it comes to tall tallies it's far more than a tall mountain.<mask>It's also a great place to hunt, fish and cultivate.<mask> <p6> is an extreme example, says <p7>, an expert in tall tall tall trees and bays in Utah.<mask>He has found, however, that tall tall grass can be a " pipe bomb."<mask>" It's just amazing to be able to get from the highest end of the range and to see the beautiful landscape that's out there.<mask>You can't just see the top end of an old canyon."<mask> <p6>'s mountain has been a big draw for locals.<mask>The area is famous for the mountains, but it was once considered a desolate desert for hikers, who used to frequent the area for days to take the tallest tall burials.<mask>Now the area has become a growing regional attraction, attracting about 400, 000 visitors every weekend, mostly from the Southwest, the Midwest and Southeast.<mask>On average, they take their last year to raise $ 40 million, he said.

<mask>Despite the defeat that had some pundits predicting, Liverpool had been crowned the best team in the world at the weekend and <p0> has been crowned <p1> top scorer.<mask>But as the countdown to Saturday's <p1> final was ticking down, Liverpool's miserable run in European football began.<mask>The 35 - year - old's team had looked doomed to lose its way against the Italians, who have dominated English football for the past few years.<mask>Liverpool took a shock lead when it finally conceded a penalty in the 64th minute and went on to score five goals in seven games.<mask>It was the second consecutive night Liverpool has gone out in the knockout round but Liverpool were never in their way.<mask>Even without the red card, a 2 - 1 victory was nothing short of a goal - scoring display and Liverpool's fans were left wondering whether they would still be able to take the show on their night.<mask>" That is my goal," <p4> told <p5> ahead of this weekend's <p6> clash against Manchester City.<mask>That defeat proved vital for Liverpool as it threatened to force a playoff in the group stages.<mask>Having been beaten 5 - 1 at home in the first leg of its Euro 2012 qualifying clash last month, Liverpool could have wrapped up a fifth straight win over Manchester City on Saturday.<mask> <p0>, which led English <p1> to glory in 2011 with 44 goals, won its first home league since 2005 but cannot claim back to 2005, as <p5> failed to reach <p1>.<mask>And now Liverpool will have a chance to repeat the triumph against Manchester United if it has beaten <p1> in the Champions League last 16.<mask>However, it's too late to save the game for a <p8> side that scored twice in the opening six minutes of the game.<mask> <p6>'s <p9> has not been part of <p1>, while the Italian coach has been criticized for failing to bring a big - spending forward to the squad despite fielding the likes of Didier <p10>, <p11> and <p12>.<mask> <p9> is the current manager of the English Premier League, but a statement on the club's official website said that a <p6> side had decided not to sign a new contract.<mask>Manchester City, currently sitting in third place with 24 points from 11 games, drew level with <p0> but they now trail by four points.
<mask>The victory keeps England's hopes of a record sixth <p0> crown alive, but it still leaves them with an unassailable 77 - 6 victory over third - placed hosts Wales at Eden Park on Sunday.<mask>In a game played amid scenes of constant controversy over <p2>, England were the dominant rugby team this year, winning 12 of the 20 matches so far, with the visitors only topping France in the quarterfinal.<mask>They are now the only side in the six - year history of the competition, but have struggled with injuries in recent years and struggled to find a way past the 21 - point deficit.<mask> <p4> gave Wales the lead after 38 minutes, before <p5> converted for Ireland to give England a 13 - 6 lead before <p6> landed a second penalty to restore parity.<mask> <p2>, who landed England's only try of the match, was on hand again as his replacement <p7> landed a late penalty and England were unable to convert a succession of five further attempts.<mask> <p12> had been on the score sheet in the first half before being charged over by scrumhalf <p13>, then <p14> went over for the third.<mask>The drop - goal, with England driving through the center, came after just five minutes as <p12> failed to convert two of England's own penalties after being caught out by Ireland winger <p15>.<mask>However, <p9> was to be restored as an unwitting replacement for former Australia fullback <p16> after being knocked out by his teammate <p17>.<mask> <p15> crossed for England to make it 15 - 7, with <p4> again scoring a try after being picked up at the right place, but Ireland were unable again and <p7> went over again for the hosts.<mask>At the other end, France beat Wales 39 - 22, and will now head to Scotland for their first <p0> title since 2003.
<mask>The sentence comes after a jury Thursday convicted <p0>, 30, of tampering with evidence and tampering with physical evidence during a miscarriage.<mask>The miscarriage occurred in May 2013.<mask> <p0> had been living with her twin sons and a son who was born after her miscarriage.
<mask>On Friday, the world watched as a new Ebola outbreak in Guinea spread to the United States and killed at least 100 people.<mask>" Now, we should put all the resources we can into preparing the communities and communities to respond to this deadly disease," Secretary of <p5> <p6> said in a statement.<mask>Now, Ebola threatens to be the single largest outbreak in U. S. history.<mask>The international response to the Ebola epidemic -- the largest in Europe -- should not be dismissed as woefully slow or apathetic.<mask>There's just one problem : the outbreak is so large it is harder and harder to control and contain.<mask> <p7> says the international response is sufficient to protect public health, but that only a limited number of people can be saved.<mask>That's why, in the coming days, <p5> will be on the ground in Guinea to work with <p8> to address the threat, protect the American public and bring the outbreak under control.<mask>This will happen within hours.<mask>Ebola has spread more than 800 cases in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.<mask>At least 100 of these cases have been confirmed or confirmed in the United Kingdom by the <p9> and the United Nations.<mask>A massive international response, including airstrikes in West Africa, will need to be coordinated in Africa.<mask>In addition, there is no vaccine to prevent Ebola, unlike a widely available vaccine.<mask>Despite the high cost of the health care services that the United Sates provided to <p4> and <p10>, the international effort will be limited, and the international community must take a robust approach.<mask> <p0> is not stopping the spread of Ebola.<mask>But, for the first time in history, it is now a national priority.
<mask>This week, the Saudi Aramco company is looking to cut its oil imports from a production shortfall of $ 3. 48 billion, in order to balance its needs, according to <p0>.<mask>CEO <p1> has also taken a hit.<mask>As <p2> considers a range of options, <p3> looks back at some of the reasons behind the price cuts.<mask>Facetime with <p0>'s <p4>.<mask>It's a big time for <p1>.<mask>But now, with demand for crude running above 3. 85 percent, he is looking for ways to reduce demand.<mask>With the discovery of crude oil, <p0> has turned to the Middle East to see how it plays out, and with other analysts looking to find out what effect these cuts will have on production.
<mask>The cost of attending college has risen 23 percent, from $ 3, 201 to $ 5, 045 per person, over the past 20 years, the report says.<mask> <p1> in 2005, the cost of college is more than $ 511, 000 per person.<mask>About 46 percent of Americans live on less than $ 3. 10 per person ; that means that one college costs $ 1. 1 billion each year.<mask>A one - hour college degree costs $ 13, 639 per person -- less than twice as much as the $ 5. 5 billion costs of attending a university, the <p1> said.<mask> <p3> students are more likely to be enrolled by the time they turn 18, the study says, and it was not until recently that an increasing number of students enrolled in private colleges are starting to graduate.<mask>The rise in the cost to college and tuition is largely driven by factors such as the availability of low - income students, higher education costs and increased competition among colleges in lower - income neighborhoods, the the <p4> report said.
<mask>For nearly two years this week, <p0> has faced more gridlock than normal.<mask>But a <p3> fact sheet released on Thursday shows some lawmakers still have some work to do.<mask>After weeks of negotiations to pass the bill, Wednesday's vote was 56 - 36, including one vote that resulted in a government shutdown.<mask>With a funding gap now between the government and most families, legislators have little room to maneuver to keep the government running.<mask>So what are the chances for getting out of the shutdown?<mask>On Wednesday, <p1> Democratic Leader <p4> sent a letter to members of <p5> urging them to consider a spending bill that provides money for the remainder of the current fiscal year to fund the government through September 28.<mask>" The <p3> needs to show restraint and cooperation between both parties, and that is why <p5> sent a note to <p1> Republican Leader <p6> expressing concern over the situation," <p4> wrote.<mask> <p4>'s letter was received by a bipartisan group of senators.<mask> <p8>, the Republican minority leader, has previously sent a similar letter to the <p5>.<mask>On Thursday, the <p16> leadership released a statement saying, " I would like to assure all members of the <p3> that our members are fully supportive of the president's work toward shutting down the government, and the need to maintain a transparent and effective federal funding system."<mask>The letter was written to members who met earlier this month with congressional leaders.<mask>The President signed it, and <p7> Secretary <p17> sent it to members Friday.<mask>If any members of Democratic caucus come out this week to criticize the deal, <p8> warns that anything to do with a spending measure " would send a message that we have shut down the federal government for one week, and we have to do something to stop that from happening," he wrote.
<mask> <p0>'s <p1> reports from Berlin for the " Inside the German Open " -- the first in the new World Cup.<mask>The team's German coach, <p2>, talks to German television network <p3>.<mask>" The team is very pleased to confirm we've reached an agreement," <p0> said in a statement.<mask> <p2> and <p2>'s company, <p4>, are on the tour of Germany with the German team to promote the new title.<mask> <p0> said the team " would like to thank all the people who have contributed so much to our team, the team, and all the German fans and fans around the world for their incredible support."<mask>Watch more on the new world championship ».<mask>Barely a month ago the team launched the world's largest electronic entry in the Bundesliga with an entry of 20 million registered users.<mask>More than 350, 000 people joined the <p3> - based club -- a club which has also helped launch careers like " Team Europe," " <p5>," " Team Germany " and " Team America."<mask>The new world domination in the latest polls took place in the Austrian town of Burgenstadion, where the team from <p4> competed for the first time.<mask>There are still plans for the next tournament and for a fourth round of matches in the winter.<mask> <p1>'s <p6> contributed to this report.
<mask> <p0> -- who has a long association with the English Premier <p1> club -- sold his $ 5. 7 million stake to a non - profit fund on the Internet last week after agreeing to the terms.<mask> <p0>, who has been linked with a move to Manchester City as a replacement for his former Liverpool teammate <p2>, confirmed his interest at <p3>'s club Twitter feed.<mask>" We are so delighted to announce we have joined <p2> and we are excited to welcome him to our new home," said the 48 - year - old, who is planning to retire at the end of the season.<mask>The former Liverpool international will become the second Cardiff supporter to sign a new contract with the club, with the <p1> side having recently signed two new players.<mask>Both have been with the London side since 2001.<mask> <p2> had retired in February 2006, but <p0> remains a Cardiff supporter and has been a regular at the club.<mask>After signing a one - year deal, he moved to <p1>, where he was keen to see the return of his former teammate, <p4>, as a club.
<mask>The <p0> is a football cheerleader who will be joined by the Big Red.<mask>And the cheerleaders will be wearing a helmet as the university's mascot, wearing the colors " Big Red " and " Blue " in its image.<mask>It's not like the old <p2> is so popular, the university has said.<mask>But for fans who like the idea of playing the mascot on a college field, it's not hard.<mask>" This mascot is like your favorite <p0>," said <p3>, a student at <p4>.<mask>He liked to watch the old Rebel game as a mascot and was a huge fan when he was a kid.<mask>"( The nickname ) was my favorite, but it was just the idea for us to make a special one, and then we started building a better mascot," he said.
<mask>The Internet is not as squeaky clean as you thought it was.<mask> <p0> are finally realizing that the way the Internet has been supposed to serve its purpose is that it is allowing people to enjoy it, say, via the Internet.<mask>That was the consensus of bloggers and pundits before a recent Pew Internet and Society poll that found 66 percent of Internet users believe it's an increasingly invasive way for people to access the Internet while abusing their smartphones or tablets.<mask>This sentiment was voiced by a <p2> panel.<mask> <p3> in 2005, the Internet was supposed to be free for everyone, but as it turned out, it was quickly overwhelmed by all the noise.<mask>People were turning to apps to search for sites, search for songs and download movies.<mask>The whole notion was then put into perspective by a poll of analysts that <p1> was about as popular as Facebook and Google combined.<mask> <p2> asked for more information on the Internet's relationship with its users.<mask>At its current point, the network has not offered any services or services that are actually users of the Internet -- including Hulu, Netflix, Netflix and search engines -- that have been widely used as a way of connecting.<mask>Users who sign up were also given the option to choose only if they liked the sites they liked or didn't like.<mask>" I would recommend going to the places where you can access the site and search and find books, newspapers and magazines," <p2> said.<mask>What that meant was that people were given the choice to either sign up for an " extremely fast search " or simply pay to be on the site.<mask> <p4> the site, those who sign on to a search page, or opt for " fast search for books or magazines," had a choice.<mask> <p8>, a nonprofit nonprofit that provides legal advice for people in need, agreed.<mask>As <p2> pointed out, " It's not really about the exact locations you are going to or the cost of a search or the type of content you're going to have access to."
<mask>This was the question posed by the North Korean government's young leader, <p0> in 2009, as it was about to put the <p1> ( <p2> ) nuclear test on pause.<mask>But it was a big misstep.<mask>As the <p3> is about to resume its nuclear work and resume its work in <p4> and <p5>, a country that has so far ignored a nuclear test, it has already invited nuclear inspectors to visit the <p2>.<mask>The <p2> said <p6>, the U. N. special envoy on Korea, was to travel to Pyongyang on Monday to talk with the <p7>, <p2> and other <p8> representatives.<mask>An <p7> spokesman declined to comment on the visit but insisted that there was " no question of intent " on its part.<mask>He added that a " comprehensive dialogue " was necessary in order to address issues in the region.<mask> <p1> is now preparing for the possible third, possibly permanent nuclear test -- which would allow North Korea to give up its nuclear capabilities and return to the nuclear negotiating table -- after the <p9> nuclear test.<mask>" We have already made some progress in denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but the likelihood of a longer term solution is very slim," he said.<mask>Under the new <p7> resolutions and <p10> agreements it has said North Korea would not abandon its nuclear program.<mask>Even with the six - party talks on the nuclear talks in Geneva on Wednesday, <p4> remains skeptical about a North Korean program.
<mask>But the nomination is more closely watched by the United States government than by a congressional investigation.<mask>The process is closed, meaning the process of confirmation is delayed.<mask>Senators have been deliberating for the better part of two weeks now to consider a nomination for <p0> Commissioner <p1>, who has been in charge of security for more than six years, since the attempted bombing of <p2> in December 2009.<mask>After much soul searching and debate, a committee in January concluded that the nomination could not be supported.<mask>It is unlikely that the committee will pass an amendment to make the nomination a motion to reject.<mask>That means no vote for the nomination.<mask>I believe that senators are now engaged in what could be a little political maneuvering to undermine the nomination, which will be extremely difficult for them to win.<mask>There are plenty of reasons to delay the nomination of Southers.<mask>First, it is clear that the process has been slow.<mask>In fact, the <p5> has not been transparent with senators for more over two decades.<mask>Since the September 11, 2001, attacks on <p8> and its employees, the system has been plagued by " a slew of politically motivated attacks."<mask>Most Republicans oppose Souters as an agency that must be open to the public.<mask>They don't believe in the idea of removing <p13> and others from security positions as a last resort to terrorist attacks, but that's not stopping senators from supporting the nomination and urging the nomination to be delayed.
<mask>This transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity :.<mask> <p4> : You've had two big events.<mask> <p2> on Monday to the airport in Darfur : There's been... a very big day in Darun, and he's coming to Kuwait to give his speech to <p5> in Cairo.<mask>And you know, he's there on Monday night, and I'm very glad he's here.<mask> <p3> : How do you feel about it?<mask>A : It's been rough.<mask>I think he's got a few days off from work.<mask>He's trying to concentrate on his speech, and at this point I don't think he understands the seriousness of the situation and of the need for the country to do more to help victims and their families.<mask>You're just a little bit disappointed, because if he's gone, you probably want to sit down with him.<mask>It's the best thing that happened to me at <p5> because I know he's been gone... and this has made it harder for me to get that kind of attention that he deserves because he's not a good guy.<mask>Watch more on <p1> ».<mask>King : You know, <p0>, you're a good actor, and you don't like being stuck in this kind of relentless, relentless pursuit of fame for a while, and sometimes you feel like it's been the worst thing ever.<mask>In the middle of it, you get this kind, this relentless pursuit to get this attention, and it can't be your job to be here because it doesn't win or win.<mask>... And if you're standing there, you want to put the attention on the war, and then when you're leaving, you dont want to be there for it.<mask>So what do you do?
<mask> <p0>, president of <p1>, says a new pandemic " has emerged in the world."<mask>" It is probably the next H1N1 virus," he said Wednesday, speaking at a conference in Chicago.<mask>But President <p9> says the new H1V virus may be an important " pathogen " that is likely to cause at least 1, 000 deaths in a year, the <p10> said in a statement.<mask>While the actual number of cases hasn't been calculated, the overall number of people with underlying medical conditions -- with just 4 to 7 percent of the cases reported -- will rise significantly, he said.<mask>A slew of new cases in the U. S. have been reported since April, officials say.<mask>In February, the hospital in <p1> was treating 1, 036 patients with the virus, compared with 1, 337 patients with a seasonal flu, the UHNN1 National Hurricane Center said.
<mask> <p0> said he was trying to gain access to the computer records of <p1>, who suffered a head injury in the 2008 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 200, 000 people.<mask> <p0> testified that he stole <p1>'s e - mail account, as well as the account of her boss, <p2>, which he accessed by hacking into her computer, according to the complaint.<mask>The lawsuit filed by <p1> seeks monetary damages and the right to a jury trial.<mask>" The defendant's attempt to have a jury of the accused commit aggravated cyber crimes at trial was clearly intended to damage the state of Michigan's current economic and public safety record," according to court documents.<mask> <p1> had been fired from her position at the time of the quake, the complaint said.<mask> <p5> documents show that <p0> accessed <p1> account by exploiting vulnerabilities in her computer to access her personal e - mails.<mask>At the time, she was working as a maintenance worker in her auto repair shop, according her e - mailed account.<mask>Once inside the computer repair shop she accessed computer files from a computer, documents show.<mask>In the e - book, a <p9> analyst says, he accessed <p6>. com e - commerce site.<mask>He then accessed a map of the United States from the computer network and downloaded his password from a scanner.<mask>When she searched the Internet, <p0> was able to identify several e - traffic ports and found a message that said, " Thanks for your help in restoring your website," according the lawsuit.<mask>Further searches uncovered that the message was from a user named " Lisa."<mask>The document did not contain any information about <p4> or her current whereabouts, it said.
<mask> <p0>, a preteen or 13 - year - old, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, also known as <p1> lymphoma, at the age of 14.<mask>He didn't develop it until at least 7 months later.<mask>And at 9 months, the age when he is diagnosed with <p1> has been creeping up.<mask>His initial response was to start a regimen of antibiotics.<mask>In the winter, it began to sink in : If there's no relief, he has to do all that.<mask>This is why when he tells anyone what's happening, he usually does it with the first dose of antibiotics or radiation.<mask>The only thing that's done is to make sure that his immune system does not develop, he says.<mask>But that's not really all.<mask> <p5> says he is still going to get a lot of pain, so his doctors are going to recommend to him that he undergo surgery before his first birthday.<mask>If there's another shock, you might have a better idea of what the reaction is.<mask>Dr. <p6>, an expert in pediatric cancer, agrees.<mask>" If you're a child with żs, there's some risk of your immune system becoming compromised, which is something that will eventually affect your immune systems," he says from the clinical trial at <p7>.<mask> <p7> says most children get anemia when they are young, and there's a great deal of risk to being a child in a particularly unsafe age group.<mask>It can be difficult to know what the exact cause is.
<mask>The announcement was a significant move, <p0> said in a statement read by Venezuela's <p1>, noting that Venezuela has a rich history of cooperation.<mask>" With two decades together, we are reaching an important point in solving the problems of subhumanity," <p1> said.<mask>In a speech to <p2> en <p3>, <p1> called on the Venezuelan people to stand up against imperialism, calling for an end to the current political and economic conflict in Venezuela.<mask>He said that while the United States and other countries are pursuing the same goals in their own countries, " we are not going to accept the same policies or practices that the American people were led by."<mask>The two leaders stressed that their shared goal is a counter - narcotics policy and the growing power of Venezuela's oil wealth.<mask> <p1> said <p3> is willing to work with them in order to defeat poverty and imperialism.<mask>The Venezuelan leader called on them to work together on improving security, education and housing.<mask> <p3> praised <p1> for helping the country's people.<mask>While in Caracas, he stressed the importance of relations between Venezuela and Iran, saying they both have a long history.<mask>There were " a lot of differences " between their nations after a nuclear dispute in the Korean Peninsula in 1950.<mask> <p0> said that the two leaders have different aims and " share the same goal," adding that both countries need to " stop the rise of imperialism and help the oppressed."<mask> <p0>'s statement came as the two men met in Havana.<mask> <p4>'s <p5> contributed to this report.
<mask>A small windowless window reveals an imposing air force.<mask>A massive plastic garbage bag is tossed from the roof of an underground railway station.<mask>The sound is so loud that <p0> says he sometimes takes a breath and turns it back on himself to hear it.<mask>" I do not even know if it is a small explosion," he says, but the explosion -- which started in the metro station last month -- is the kind of noise that has plagues India for decades.<mask>People complain about the sound pollution because of its sheer size and density.<mask> <p0> says the city has created a " noise island " of pollution that can be categorized as a small, residential area.<mask>That means, if there is a loud building nearby, it is likely to be a nearby house.<mask>Some say the noise makes people feel sick or dizzy.<mask>And, <p0> and others say, it can be dangerous.<mask>In a village with a population of more than 7 million, many people complain about not being able to get to a local mosque.<mask>India's population is a minority.<mask>At home, one in three residents comes from outside India.<mask>More than 70 % of the residents complain that they don't have access to public transportation and other basic services.<mask>They complain about being kept indoors and not having access to fresh air.<mask>With a lot of noise and a population that is so small, many residents complain, " We are not safe."
<mask> <p0> says the pain of losing his life is still felt today.<mask>( <p0> ) -- The pain of grieving -- with pain, with a loss -- still lingers today. "<mask>It has hit me the hardest," says <p1>, who came to find himself in the midst of it when he was the only man alive.<mask>But the pain, he says, is still fresh.<mask>" It hasn't sunk in yet.<mask>I can't see how it could get worse."<mask>For <p1> and his wife, <p2>, the pain has hit all of us in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.<mask> <p2>'s death was the latest of an overwhelming series of cases, bringing a level of pain that, while still shocking, was never too distant.<mask>A few of them weren't.<mask> <p1>, in the waning hours of the week, was the life he wanted.<mask>One man with Alzheimer's, the lone survivor, was in bed in his 60s, the first patient to die in the line of duty since the late 1950s.<mask> <p5>, his wife and the last to see him, were the ones who came, according to the <p1>.<mask>They saw each other more than a dozen times.<mask>The two had seen each other three times in their lives and one saw each another once, on each occasion, for the first time.<mask>Each time, they'd seen each another, and there was a same intensity -- perhaps more, at times, in a way that made the other feel like they had been in a movie, but that it was worth the wait, and the wait.
<mask>The United Kingdom is on the verge of being the world's largest democracy, and the current uncertainty surrounding the status of the union has left it vulnerable to a severe political crisis.<mask>Yet we have seen this conflict repeatedly.<mask>As it unfolds, the prospect of an increasingly turbulent global relationship has already created an environment in which two of its major allies could become increasingly involved in other ways, such as a new power sharing system between the United States and Germany.<mask>Britain has enjoyed a strong role in the United Kingdom's efforts to deal with challenges at home, but its key ally is Ireland.<mask>While Ireland is on a roll of the dice, its role in making progress and economic growth possible are limited.<mask>This means that, although the UK is expected to continue to play a key role in Ireland's recovery, its own relationship with the Republic will likely fall away over time.<mask>For this reason, there is still much work to be done, particularly as countries become more dependent on Ireland.
<mask>The young, pre - fuzzy cubs have been at home, sleeping at a friend's house and their new neighbors say.<mask>One of them took to Twitter to vent a little resentment and concern about being shut down in Atlanta's <p0>.<mask>" Dear # camelie picnoprases @ chavezcandanga and @ camelteacrases # cuzafrases," the tweet read.<mask> <p2>, which also has its own Twitter feed, has since clarified that they've been released, and they're trying to get their lives back in order.<mask> <p1>, <p3> affiliate <p4> reported that the city's fire department is searching for people in the area who are " assisting with the situation " as it moves through its investigation.<mask>As of Friday morning, <p12> ( <p13> ) had been assisting police in their probe and arrests.<mask>According to <p3>'s <p14>, the department is in contact with several hundred citizens from the city.<mask>The sheriff's department was already in talks with them to have more officers in the city, <p2> said.<mask>When the department did talk to them, they responded only to " some concerns " and the department plans to " take a look at that as well," according to Sgt.<mask> <p7>, the police department's spokeswoman.<mask> <p8> police are still working to " confirm what happened," she said.
<mask>But for a while, you may have to spend your downtime with a creative or creative partner.<mask> <p0> on his adventures around the world, we asked <p1>'s <p2> to give us just a few facts that help you make your time on your feet more enjoyable.<mask> <p2> : Why do you spend so much time on the road doing such a thing?<mask>RN : I spend so many hours doing this.<mask> <p1> : How long has it been since I began doing this project?<mask>I started at a knitting studio in New Jersey where I got a lot of time on time off from work and I found it really interesting.<mask>My interest in knitting started when I was a little kid, so I was looking for a hobby, and I decided to try to create something that really wasn't for the faint of heart that I had found in <p1>.<mask>That's how I started the project.<mask>The project was started by my husband, who had already worked in the knitting shop, and with <p2>, he was a great fit.<mask>But it became a very serious business when I began work at the knitting company.<mask>I was working on a new program called <p5>, and after two years I realized that there were many people doing knitting work at different local level.<mask>After much soul searching, I realized, " I can relate to knitting."<mask>So I made a very short video video called " When I Come Around " which I took that I would post all the pictures and I'd create all the pieces and I would put them together to create and then I had a number of brilliant pieces and then sell them to the online community.<mask>When I finished, I just went through this project and started using them as a sort of online product.<mask>And I started creating and selling all these pieces.
<mask>A woman walks past a destroyed house Thursday after a 6. 1 magnitude earthquake hit Costa Rica.<mask>The official death toll was expected to rise because the quake's depth was so shallow, said <p0>, spokesman for <p1>.<mask>A <p1> official said the dead bodies were from people in a residential neighborhood in San Jose, where officials have found bodies.<mask> <p1> is trying to determine the status of additional victims.<mask>Officials also said an official death count will be updated Saturday afternoon.<mask> <p5> of <p1> on Friday said he feared additional victims would be added Saturday.<mask> <p7>, a professor at <p8> in San Diego, said he did not think the deaths were directly related to Thursday's quake.<mask>" It's very difficult for my heart to believe that a 6 quake was so strong.<mask>It shook the building in an earthquake that could shake you to your core, you would think that a large earthquake could happen," he said.<mask>He said the 7. 0 - magnitude temblor struck at about 4 p. m.

<mask>That's the view of <p0>, a British businessman who is being accused of being the " architect " of a scheme that aims to topple Japan's one - child policy.<mask>A little over a month into his career, Hori hasn't finished making it to London.<mask>As he prepares to compete in the biggest sporting event yet, Horimian shows off his Olympic preparation with a demolition of his home gym, a demolition job and a shooting spree at a nearby indoor arena.<mask>It's a match he never gets used to : It was a fight with <p1> -- the man who replaced <p2> as prime minister in 2005.<mask> <p6> says he's never done anything wrong, but not so strongly.<mask>On April 18 he was in attendance at the Olympics, in front of a crowd that packed <p9> in Osaka, the Japanese capital, and he was a big, huge favorite.<mask>He had been to the Olympics many times before, but this time, Horimoto was the architect of this Games.<mask>" This one is bigger than the Olympics.<mask>This is very important," he explained.<mask>The architect is <p0>.<mask> <p1> was a renowned architect who, in the words of <p10>, " created the <p11>."<mask>He was also instrumental in creating an industrial design that was used to modernize buildings like the Empire State Building, adding tons of steel and concrete to the site's façade and giving the Olympics a modern feel.<mask>But, as Hori, a father of two young children, didn't think much about it at the time.<mask> <p10> also wanted to make Japan a more modern country, but " don't take a look at the world's aging athletes," he noted.<mask>Not only did he design the new stadium, but he also built the logistics for the project.

<mask>But what's important is that the vast majority of the large storms that make landfall are just " abnormal " and are highly predictable.<mask> <p2> are so big that even though they're often smaller, they're dangerous.<mask>They can easily have catastrophic consequences on our way to major disasters.<mask>At least eight of these were <p2> hurricanes.<mask>The most dangerous is Hurricane Donna in 2005.<mask>This was caused by a powerful storm surge in the Gulf of Mexico, which was moving south - northwest at about 20 mph ( 26 kph ).<mask> <p1> of the storm and its impact are devastating -- it is the second - largest category of hurricane and the second one the top - tier of the list, respectively, after Hurricane Katrina.<mask>So what are typical tropical storms?<mask>We don't have a lot to think about.<mask>But storms are generally large and often are extremely destructive.<mask> <p1> is a different category.<mask>These are tropical storms that have sustained winds of 120 mph ( 165 kph ) at the peak of their activity.<mask>Some of these storms, like Hurricane Julio, were so large that they blew off roofs.<mask>Still others are large and destructive.
<mask>Until recently, television shows had to run thousands of seconds on a network with fewer viewers, with viewers losing their ability to watch -- if not their sense of smell.<mask>That's now changing.<mask>And it's not just the lack of viewers.<mask> <p2>, senior vice president for product strategy for the <p3>, said there is a growing body of ad space that needs the <p4> to produce a commercial.<mask>The trend of watching TV has slowly developed.<mask>Some viewers are watching television a few times a week, while others aren't.<mask>In November, <p1> released a new " smart spot " ad to show the " health care " debate.<mask>This year, the network will be showing 15 minutes on a large network instead of the 30 minute one.<mask>It will air 12 minutes of a single show on a small network, said <p1>, and there will be more commercials.<mask>" If you want to see TV ad space, you have to use a network," <p1> said.<mask>"[ But ] this is going to be a big network audience, and I think they're going to continue to make decisions about what viewers want, who they want to watch, how much they watch and how much should they watch."<mask>There are more than 150 companies in the U. S. -- in particular, the <p7> and <p8>, all big cable broadcasters.<mask>But <p2> said, " It's not about quantity."<mask>The network has been working with states to get fewer viewers and make the network more attractive to people, but the United States is not interested in spending more money.<mask> <p6>, senior director of <p9> at <p10>, said the average American spends about $ 1, 000 per TV ad.

<mask>Now a new study reveals that you may be the only person who can get away with chronic jingles.<mask> <p2> - ups and jiggles are often triggered by an underlying health condition, which can include jiggling and fibromyalgia.<mask>Researchers at Mothan School of Medicine in Massachusetts found that people who jig collectively " can significantly reduce jiggledness and pain " by shedding weight from their lifestyles.<mask>The researchers also found that jigging was actually a symptom of the condition known as fibromyria, a condition of arthritis that affects the nervous system.<mask>" This condition has been a leading cause of chronic jiggle in childhood," says the lead author, <p2>.<mask>In fact, the study, which appears in <p4>, found that this type of jigting can increase the risk of cognitive and language problems later on in life.<mask>Health. com : 10 surprising things to keep in mind.<mask>When asked about the specific jiggers that may trigger jigglings, 38 percent of participants said they jig separately from other jigging pairs.<mask>Twenty - three percent of jjimming pairs said they don't jig for more than one reason or another -- the same amount of jiggly activity as other jigglers, and the typical increase in jig - related weight.<mask>But even a person with a history of jibing could be uncomfortable with jig troubles.<mask>One study found that in many patients, jig bites are caused by a lack of concentration in their joints.<mask>Two other studies published in <p7>, such as the recent <p8> study, found the jig use is a serious and chronic problem.<mask>( People jig more often than not are the most common culprit.)<mask>Health : How to get off your jig.<mask>A 2009 study in the journal Archives of Neurology estimated that jigurates may affect people's IQ.

<mask>A few months ago, Chancellor <p0> made it clear that she would not stand idly by while <p1> continues to fight a hunger for eurozone membership.<mask> <p1>'s leaders responded to these concerns with an unending barrage of verbal jabs and taunts.<mask> <p4> <p5> even threatened to cancel a summit in Germany to promote " solidarity " between the two countries.<mask>For all the damage, <p1> is the country's most important political ally.<mask>And for the past decade, she has been the prime minister's top personal choice in the country.<mask>Yet, after a decade of political deadlock, Merkel has been asked to reconsider a commitment to German reunification.<mask>She has refused.<mask>As <p3>'s <p6> noted in a recent article, " Her leadership has had to consider her personal role for years -- it's in her role as Chancellor for the next five years -- and now she also has to consider how to create the new Germany.<mask>" Her leadership should not have to wait around for <p3> to decide whether to invite a renegade member of the <p1>.<mask> <p5> should simply decide whether Germany's strong economic growth will be sustainable or sustainable and should be supported by other countries."<mask> <p7> and its allies also share the responsibility of forming Germany's alliances with other member states.<mask> <p0> has already made it her top priority to support German reunions.<mask>But <p0> must be reminded that even as the two nations continue to cooperate on the world stage, Germany must do more to ensure that reunification is achieved.<mask> <p3>'s Munich correspondent, <p8>, asked a number of her reporters about the economic difficulties facing Germany.

<mask>With two presidential campaigns under way, <p0>'s biggest takeaway was that his family didn't just lose jobs or have enough cash.<mask> <p0>'s family loses hundreds.<mask>And now the president is poised to lose control of his own party.<mask>On Wednesday, former President <p0>, the first Republican in decades, was speaking in favor of the Republican nominee, saying that while he doesn't anticipate the nation's economy crashing out of this year's midterm elections, " I would like to be president of the United States of America, and the American people deserve a president of their own.<mask>I would hope that <p1> and his family and the people of the country would be more generous in our response to the economy."<mask>In an interview with <p1>'s <p2>, <p3> pointed out the fact that his father was not a Republican and didn't vote for <p0>.<mask>" I think I was a bit of an idiot," <p0> said.<mask>But on <p5>'s " This Week " on Wednesday, he added that the <p4> administration " did not want to talk about the economy right away."<mask>" It's not that I'm an American.<mask>It's that I was willing to do something that I thought was not going to be a good thing for America," he said, according to <p2>.<mask>Asked if he would run for president again, Perhaps his answer would have been to use his economic skills to help ailing families.<mask>The criticism against <p0> comes as <p0> is intensifying his criticism of his family, including his comments about the Iraq war, his opposition to <p6> and his handling of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the U. S. embassy.<mask>Some in the party have questioned whether <p0> would do anything different than <p0> during his time in office.<mask> <p2> Senior Political Analyst <p7> recently asked him whether <p1> is doing anything different from <p0> and why.<mask>This : It's a question for the past year, and it's also a question we don't have a clear answer.
<mask>The South African Ballet has invested a combined $ 250 million in its nearly 150 production suites over a five - year period, according to the company's CEO <p0>.<mask>The company says the company already has more than 5, 000 employees, providing the dancers with a range of training and jobs.<mask>For them, the income is just a token contribution to keep the company solvent until the end of the year.<mask>According to the South African dance company <p2>, its operations account for 80 % of the company.<mask>It expects that, after an initial initial round of production, it will be able to make up a large proportion of its income from its production costs.<mask>" We hope that the rest of the time we will be generating the funds we have earned from rehearsal costs, not as dancers who are not making that kind of money," says <p2>.<mask>In return, the company makes sure its brand is not in doubt.<mask>But, as with any company, the concept of investing in dancers has to be tweaked to suit the industry's needs.<mask> <p0> says that by making the moves necessary to keep a firm financial system stable, there's a danger that one of the underlying factors behind the company is to be out of business.<mask>"[ When ] we are not doing well at the moment it's not for us to make a lot of money from rehearsal and production costs ; in the absence of competition, we can't do anything," says says <p0>, whose company has invested about $ 150 million in other projects, including a television show about <p3>.<mask>As well as being a showcase for South African culture, dancers with the <p1> can also become a launching pad for an international art festival.<mask>See also : South African art scene's'brilliant new skyscraper'In South Africa, companies like the Tate Taylor and <p4> are hoping the city's dynamic art scene, and its ability to attract international audiences, will transform the industry.<mask>What does that mean?<mask>According <p1> director of contemporary dance, " There's no question the arts industry is at risk of closing for good because the financial situation in the country is difficult for many of us to deal with," says Swain.<mask> <p2> and his team are spearheading the spearhead of <p0>'s venture, an initiative that aims to help bring more of the city to economic and cultural level.
<mask>But a woman from Johannesburg, South Africa, has overcome death threats to bring better healthcare and better lives to the poorest corners of the continent.<mask>Her efforts have resulted in <p1> becoming the first known HIV - positive woman to be licensed in the country.<mask>With more than 100 confirmed cases in Sierra Leone this year, the nurse can do more than provide services to poor and disabled communities by providing free HIV care.<mask> <p1> will also serve as the official spokesperson for the country's <p2>.<mask>" <p2> is a highly visible example of HIV / AIDS being a worldwide issue," she said.<mask>At the height of <p1>'s success, she was trying to lead the medical community in a country where HIV is rampant.<mask>She says that the issue has affected the poorest parts of the African nation, where the number of HIV - negative people is highest.<mask>But this hasn't been just one of her goals.<mask>In 2012, she said she saw more than 5, 700 cases in South Africa -- mostly in the poorest areas -- and said she was seeing more cases as the number increased.<mask>The most disturbing aspect of <p0> story is that she is being forced to speak out for the first time since the deadly disease took hold of her family.<mask> <p0> spoke exclusively to <p3>'s <p4> about her life and what she sees as barriers to access to improved care.
<mask>In fact, she's already exceeded the weight of her typical teenage daughter, a daughter who weighs between 6. 4 pounds and 6. 6 pounds.<mask> <p0>'s size inspired the new movie " You Are Beautiful," which opened Saturday, " X - Men : Days of Future Past," which features an electro - imaging - induced energy boost.<mask> <p2>'s " My Life Too " co - star <p3> told <p4> on Wednesday that the " X " phenomenon is just a coincidence.<mask>" In our lives, you can't be big, but the thing about'X - Men'is that we are all smaller.<mask>We're all smaller and we don't have to worry about who is bigger, but we all work different jobs," <p9> said.<mask>In the film, <p2>'s character is <p10>, a self - proclaimed " <p11> princess " who's been working to increase her personal energy.<mask>She takes in billions of dollars in advertising annually.<mask>Since the release of the first " X "- Men " in October, <p1>, 25, has spent a total of about $ 1. 2 million on merchandise.<mask>For a performance, she says, she is not afraid to sell her clothes and makeup because they're made of what she calls " natural fabrics."<mask>" They make sure that everything is in sync with the way we look, and they're making the clothes look natural," Kinzel told <p9>.<mask>Even though her size isn't a problem with most people, she said, it's important to keep in mind " when it comes to our bodies."<mask> <p7> spoke with <p1> from her <p12> home in Los Angeles, where she is recovering from the multiple surgeries she underwent for a metabolic stress fracture.<mask>Her latest frame of living has been swollen and her speech was slurred from the first surgery.<mask>A follow - up to " X Factor," a documentary about the show, debuted at No.<mask>1 on the iTunes Hot 100 chart.

<mask> <p0> <p1>, who heads the department's intelligence bureau, said there was not a " secret " U. S. government program in that country.<mask>" The question is not whether we spy on people ; if we track people who are suspected of espionage," he said.<mask>If the investigation is conducted, a national police force would investigate the activities of the United States, he said, adding, " It is not something that has been reported or confirmed."<mask> <p1> said the government had opened an investigation in the case but did not comment on when.<mask>She said she didn't know yet whether it was possible.<mask> <p0> authorities in the nation are investigating the allegations made by former <p0> contractor <p2>, whose allegations have prompted outrage in Norway.<mask>A Norwegian television station published a report Tuesday about the extent to which the United Nations had carried out so - called metadata, or " foreign intelligence " surveillance of virtually all Norwegians for about a year.<mask>The report included e - mails and phone calls between people in each country in which the suspect discussed communications with other U.

<mask>" There are a lot of groups opposing gays and lesbians marrying in the U. S.<mask>Most of us have a very limited sense of whether gays and lesbian people have civil rights.<mask>It's a debate that's really heated," <p1>, a professor at <p2> <p3> and author of " Same - Sex Americans : An Immigration - based Political History."<mask>One area where <p3> has largely been more careful is the relationship between President <p4> and his Republican opponents.<mask>In his recent speech, he noted that the president has been " cautious " on his views of same - sex marriage -- saying he was " going to be cautious " when he decides to honor the unions of <p2> justices, not as the party's presumed <p5> nominee but as the " moral leader " of his party.<mask> <p0> endorsement may be a bit surprising.<mask>The president has repeatedly reaffirmed his support for same - gender marriage, but his stance on same - aisle marriage has become increasingly controversial among conservatives and the <p2>.<mask>He told a <p2> faculty meeting in June that the issue is not about <p4>'s own personal freedom.<mask>" What is going to happen with gays and <p0> being able to go for a divorce and for one of their wives to go back to the marriage certificate and have children?<mask>What will happen with the ( other ) <p8> program?"<mask> <p5> spokeswoman <p9> said.<mask> <p10> on gay marriage is more difficult, she said. "<mask>The issues, which <p0> has tried to address on the campaign trail, are not the same," she added.<mask>That includes the challenges of protecting the rights of gays and their children, which she said " has been an issue in this country " and that, " the administration's inability to act quickly on these issues has led to a very public paralysis on the issue."<mask> <p18> marriage : What is happening in the United States?

<mask>His photo op took place at <p0>, a political science conference and <p1>'s home state of Florida.<mask> <p0> has long been viewed as the unlikely candidate for the Republican nomination, and now its <p2> field is even more crowded with potential 2016 contenders.<mask>But <p1>, who turns 50 on Saturday, also had a strong leg up in <p3>, a key position that he's unlikely to follow in his father's footsteps.<mask>In fact, <p0> has been in the room since early last year.<mask>Before this spring, Â <p0> was just as much an outsider as <p4> was.<mask>A <p2> nominee, he was a smart man and a rising star in the <p2> -- a new <p2> president, a <p2> that Republicans were excited about and had a deep connection with.<mask>So, for starters, <p6>, who had worked closely with President <p7> on immigration and Wall Street, had a chance to play a key role in that direction.<mask>Not only did he play a leading role in shaping the way the party handles immigration reform, he played an important role in influencing the way Democrats look at the next election.<mask>How the new <p4> might shape <p8> nomination.<mask>After he ran the 2012 <p5>, he seemed the more hawkish of the two parties, and the <p9> candidate who could be viewed as a moderate and an alternative to President <p10>.<mask>His success has not necessarily been the result of a successful, long - term reform campaign.<mask>During the 2000 election, ills were tallied.<mask>Republicans'longterm leadership suffered a major fall in midterm elections.<mask>President <p7> took off from his post as the nation's first ever Republican president.<mask>He seemed determined to help the middle class recover, but the economy kept funding the government and debt.
<mask>So what if the nude images were so horrifying and disturbing that they caused shockwaves?<mask>Or horrifying enough?<mask>Those are just some of the answers to those questions -- and so we asked experts who have analyzed more than a dozen videos from <p0>.<mask>Here's a sampling :.<mask>THE STUDENT NEWS.<mask>The first thing you should know : If people don't know about the dangers of pornography online, the Web can be a major trouble.<mask> <p2> has learned a lot about digital piracy, which means it's now difficult to surf the Web, especially on the day of the death.<mask>" While people have a lot of access to content, they don't really have much control over what they're going to do," said <p2> Assistant Director - General for <p3>.<mask>It's possible that cyber pirates are responsible for the cyber attacks, and they're not just targeting <p3> and other websites that broadcast these messages.<mask>But cyber pirates aren't just a problem, said <p3> professor <p4>.<mask>They're also a way for people to get a sense of the potential impact of cyber attacks on websites with links to sites like WikiLeaks.<mask>After watching the content of <p0>'s videos online and viewing them online, it's likely that it's not just because it's part of the content.<mask> <p4> said that by viewing the content online, " you're able to make more personal statements about the value of the work being done for you."<mask> <p6>, a professor of cyber security at <p7>, said " you can make a huge profit off it if you think that the content is real and what you're doing with it is being done with a lot less of real human capital."<mask> <p7> is a nonprofit website that provides legal and academic advice to law enforcement agencies.

<mask>I don't want to get into that.<mask>If you're <p0> or <p1> supporter, you know what?<mask>This movement is changing.<mask>That's why I'm asking the question : What does a " Tea Party " movement believe in?<mask> <p0> is not a radical <p1> movement or a " liberal " <p2> movement.<mask>The movement is a movement of those who believe in social justice and don't talk about government.<mask>It is a group that has been energized by issues such as gun control and education.<mask>When it comes to social justice, <p0> is different than other people.<mask>In a sense, they are the " conservative " and " liberal."<mask>I think people have been realizing that " that was a myth in the 1960s.<mask>" I know I'm the same age as most of the younger generation," Warren said.<mask>But they aren't just talking about a changing culture.<mask>They're talking about growing the government.
<mask>A solar eclipse, which spanned a continent and sent the Earth at 1, 775 feet above sea level, was projected to take place in the night sky.<mask>It was the first solar eclipse ever to strike the U. S. coast.<mask> <p1> and other sunsets have been documented on the planet since 9 / 11, when the moon shone for the first time.<mask>Most of the sunsets were caused by a combination of factors.<mask>The sun's rays bounced across the planet and were seen in Greenland and Iceland, and on the Pacific coast of the United States.<mask>But even with the best of the best light, stunning clouds and cloudy skies are still stunning across the globe.<mask>Many of the most stunning images, from the moment of the eclipse, are being projected onto Earth.<mask>See a gallery of some of the more stunning eclipse images.
<mask> <p0>, 60, is a top leader of <p1> in Afghanistan and is accused of funding the attacks against U. S. soldiers based in Pakistan and in the United States.<mask>The indictment accuses Mehsud of " conspiring to kill individuals based on their affiliation or their views on a basis of international law," including U. N. Security Council resolutions that prohibit military attacks against civilians.<mask>There is no death penalty in Pakistan.<mask> <p2>.<mask>He was arrested in 2008, and he is accused in the 2009 killings of seven U. M. citizens in eastern Afghanistan, <p1> spokesman <p3> told <p4> in October.<mask>They were found to have been killed in an ambush.<mask>A subsequent search of the house and the <p17> - linked <p1> hotel found explosives, <p3> said.<mask>None of the people were killed.<mask>All seven Americans died in the attack.<mask> <p9> has said <p0> was responsible for the attack and has never claimed responsibility for it.<mask>In October, <p8> indicted Mehsuds on the counts of murder, conspiracy and kidnapping for his involvement in the November 2009 deaths of the seven U.- S. military personnel.<mask> <p7> attorney general's office in the District of Columbia also filed charges, alleging he had sought to kill a prominent figure in <p1>.<mask> <p1>, which controls the Swat Valley, claimed responsibility in the indictment, saying it was retaliation for the Pakistani government's support of <p2> attacks against its own civilians.
<mask>published by <p0> ).<mask> <p0> says immigrants need to take responsibility for their own lives.<mask>SAN ANTONIO, Texas ( <p0> ) -- " The immigration debate isn't over yet."<mask>At least <p0> said that's a possibility.<mask>According to <p0>, the Republican leader made a surprise appearance Wednesday at the conservative conference of <p1> and a number of speakers -- all of them -- to talk about immigration and the need to reform the nation's immigration system.<mask>While most people think that President <p2> is the solution to all the <p3> woes, the reality is that our immigration system is struggling.<mask>Many major cultural and political parties are broken and struggling to cope with the economic crisis in the United States.<mask>At the conference, I pointed out that there are about 4 million undocumented workers in America.<mask>That's 20, 000 more than in Germany and 7 million more than the Czech Republic.<mask>The problem, I argued, is that a comprehensive immigration reform package is not a solution to the problem, because only a passing solution would help fix it.<mask>There are many reasons to start the conversation.<mask>One is that immigration reform is needed for a comprehensive economy and is not an easy way to do it.
<mask> <p0>.<mask>The joint effort, dubbed " Smart on Crime," has netted 1. 2 million fugitives since its inception in 2001, according to <p0>. com.<mask> <p1> enforcement officials will work to help people find a way to arrest fugitives.<mask>About 3. 2 percent of the total total seized are fugitives, the bureau said.<mask> <p2> from the U.

<mask> <p0> has developed an idea which might well allow the universe to grow a lot larger.<mask>The space program is leading the scientific revolution in understanding the mysteries of gravity.<mask>A billion billion kilometers of space.<mask>That's the width of a football field and it's much larger than a soccer field.<mask>It's the size of the United States, so <p0> is calling on the U. S. government to come up with a detailed map of its own.<mask>To the <p0>, which makes its own spacecraft and spacecraft, it is also looking at how gravity has played a role in the formation of space systems.<mask>When you look at gravity, it's the way it pulls you up into the clouds : how how does it pull you out of the clouds?<mask>It is a way of life, so the Â £ 25 billion ( about $ 32 billion ) project is one of the best ways to achieve that goal.<mask>In recent years, scientists have come up several times with ideas for an Earth - sized planet.<mask>But space scientists have had a very different approach.<mask>Researchers have recently developed an alternative, a galaxy that has a <p2> ( <p3> ) system that looks at light - source observations.<mask>Using the latest spacecraft's instruments, they now can take measurements of the density of the stars within a galaxy's habitable zone, in the That distance from the star to the Earth.<mask>They then compare the amounts they collect with the distance from a star.<mask>Because of that, the researchers have made an algorithm that calculates how much of the star's nitrogen and carbon is in the atmosphere.<mask>Rather than the hard - to - find data, though, it would be much cheaper than a computer algorithm that does that.
<mask>The man was taken into custody by police in the southwest London borough of Woolwich, <p0> said.<mask> <p0> said it did not have further details.<mask>A spokesman for the police would not say what type of alleged offenses had been committed.<mask>The inquiry is part of the wider investigation into " <p2>," the broadcaster's television show in which the late entertainer and charity icon was the star attraction.<mask> <p3> was also known as " Top Gun " and the " Top Gear."<mask> <p0> and the broadcaster were the target of an enormous firestorm after an investigation into the alleged abuses by a number of former victims.<mask>In March, a London jury convicted the 77 - year - old of predatory sexual offenses against four men aged 15 to 84.<mask>" You are very fortunate that a man of your age and your past can be brought to justice for crimes which you have committed against children," Sir <p2> said at the time.<mask>Police will seek to interview <p0>'s relatives, who will then be interviewed by detectives, the spokesman said.

<mask>Last year I was working in the southern city of Shanghai, where thousands of Chinese companies were stranded by China's high - volume telecom telecom.<mask>For me, it was a time of intense competition and despair.<mask>I wasn't alone.<mask>While China was on a roller coaster with global business and financial crisis, there was a new mindset emerging among many businesses that could benefit from the changes in the country.<mask>As Chinese telecom companies began to develop and improve their infrastructure and strategies for their operations, I asked my team of former <p2> to share their thoughts on this change in business strategy.<mask> <p3> and the internet has changed the way we engage with customers.<mask>The Internet has been in the service industry for nearly 40 years, and has become a leading player for <p0> -- a mobile network that's the platform by which <p4>'s <p5> and <p6> can connect to customers, connect with friends and gather information.<mask> <p1>, vice president of consumer development and research at <p7> ( GEM ) says that Chinese companies can grow their subscriber base in a much greater way than the U. S. market.<mask>We know that, for instance, China's consumers are more connected to a number of industries on the internet than to other countries.<mask>And as a result, this is changing customer preferences, as more respondents are now using the internet, which allows them to compare information to relevant websites.<mask>So, as a response to this shift, we set up <p2>. com, a company that offers Chinese language language services and advice to consumers and investors.<mask>" The main thing is we try to provide them a real window of opportunity and we are able to provide that window to them," <p1> said.<mask>Read more : Chinese internet adopters catch a whiff of change.<mask>With a large number of users, <p4> can communicate directly with customers and share information on the latest developments.<mask>But the same can be done for businesses in China's increasingly populous northeast, such as schools, hospitals, theaters and mobile phone networks.

<mask>A lawyer for the two terminally ill patients says they hope to get a doctor to help them.<mask>A court has ruled that a person can be competent to care for them until their death.<mask> <p2> Judge <p3> ruled Tuesday that <p4>, 49, had the right to get help when it took place.<mask>She wrote that <p5>, 41, was in New Mexico with her husband when she committed suicide last year, after they were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <p6>, or <p7>, and they had suffered a brain tumor.<mask>The lawsuit filed by <p2> claimed that <p8>, 48, had suffered from the disease for more than 60 years, and that it made her so unhappy she wanted her own doctor to decide her fate.<mask>Her husband suffered from it for more years, when he was diagnosed with it and told not to talk to anyone until it was diagnosed.<mask> <p0> and <p6> filed a lawsuit.<mask>On Wednesday, they filed a brief in court to overturn the judge's ruling.<mask> <p8> attorneys said <p2>'s ruling was based on " unconstitutional and inaccurate " notions that the medical professionals at <p9> -- the state's medical board -- are biased against <p5>.<mask>" <p6> has no judicial power over a patient's personal life," said <p10>, an attorney for <p8>.<mask> <p6> and <p5> were married for 12 years, filed for divorce and filed for separation of ends after they divorced in 2010.<mask> <p3> said she believed that <p10> was wrong to deny <p5> visitation rights.<mask> <p12>, the lawyer for <p0>, says he hopes the case will be heard.<mask> <p7> said he plans to file a lawsuit against the state.<mask>He was released from a hospital in February, but was not in the city when he committed suicide, according to court documents.

<mask>She loves the trees and the culture of Santa, and when she got to the Santa Pole, her family was thrilled.<mask>But her dad, <p0>, is not so happy about Christmas.<mask>And she worries that there's an online campaign that calls on her to vote for a nominee in the next election.<mask> <p1> is a Republican congressman.<mask>For his part, she worries about what might become of her family's holiday.<mask>" We get asked lots of questions.<mask>Is it the same thing for everybody?"<mask> <p1>, a stay - at - home mom who also runs a travel blog called <p2>, asked her about the recent announcement.<mask>A few minutes into their talk, the <p4> executive jumped into action.<mask>She was asked what she thinks of the campaign, and she answered, " It's something that needs to be vetted."<mask>She is the first candidate who thinks of a credible and independent candidate, though she's far from alone in her decision to vote.<mask>Why is this campaign so important to her family?<mask>" I think that we're a bit surprised," she said.<mask>The campaign is so fierce that in a blog post on the campaign's website, she wrote, " We want to raise awareness of the importance of this year's election and the efforts of our volunteers in advancing this campaign."<mask>In a statement to <p2> affiliate <p5>, the Obama campaign said, " In 2008, we had over 800, 000 registered voters who voted for us.
<mask>However, the study notes that among all these sites, almost all ( 22. 5 percent ) were sites that raised or raised the minimum age for a child.<mask>So, if you're asking the question of whether your child is on Facebook because it's a social network -- or is actually on Facebook -- you're missing a point.<mask>In the study, Pew compared Facebook and <p0> data with <p1>'s data, and found that almost two - thirds of all those surveyed didn't meet the minimum parental - supervision age requirements for a social networking site like Facebook.<mask>" The vast majority of kids across the country are now using <p1> for social network services, even though they're not quite as young as we used to be," says <p2>, a spokesman for <p3>.<mask>What is this data telling us about the skyrocketing adoption rate of young users?<mask>We're told that the typical youth in the U. S. are between 15 and 24 years old.<mask>And as a general rule, they're most likely to be on Facebook as early as 13, but many of them will still use sites like " MySpace " and " My Schooled Me."<mask> <p2> says the real data, however, is much more revealing than what really matters :.<mask> <p5>, 19 - year - old. com : Are you using Facebook for your birthday?<mask> <p4> : I'm not sure.<mask>We don't really know.<mask>Some data we can't actually use is still being analyzed by the experts in social network marketing, but some of the evidence is still very interesting.<mask>To find out if there's been any connection between Facebook and MySpace, it would probably be important to use something similar to MySpace on your school years -- and that's still the only site that's actually relevant.<mask>However I can't tell you whether I'm being more realistic in that data, because I don't think <p2> is relevant at all.<mask>Even though the majority of American kids are using <p0> and My SchoolED Me, a social platform not related to that data is still not there.
<mask>He was 88.<mask> <p0> died in his home in Salzburg on February 3 at the age of 93.<mask>He started his career with <p5> as a technical engineer in 1945, according to his company.<mask>Although <p0> never took the driving lessons he learned in his early years, he was still busy on the streets and in cars by his own admission.<mask>" The son of a garage manager, <p0>'s passion for Porsche was always growing and he is at the heart of the engineering and design processes behind it," his company said in a statement.<mask>After graduating from <p0> in 1947, <p1> began his full - time job as an executive officer in <p6> and later took over as chief executive officer of <p7> in 2005, according <p8>, the company's marketing manager.<mask>The young engineer was one of the first in line to lead <p2> when it debuted the 911 in 2001.<mask>His work led to the company selling a number of vehicles, starting with its first 911 in 1991.<mask>A few years later he was awarded the <p6>'s <p9>, an award that went to three engineers for their performance record, testing the 911.<mask> <p9> was renamed " <p0> 911."<mask> <p11> of <p12>, which owns <p1>, said in 2010 that <p0> was honored by his " tireless efforts " to overcome automotive problems and provide quality models and services.<mask> <p5> has more than 4, 000 vehicles in all, <p8> said.<mask>In 2005, <p7> announced plans to manufacture a new 911 and a full - service production vehicle by 2014.<mask>Funeral arrangements have not yet been announced, <p11> said.
<mask>The announcement comes after British Prime Minister <p0> unexpectedly announced last week that he would seek to become Britain's prime minister in January 2015 if he wins elections.<mask>" I recognize that our future depends on a referendum on our union," Cameron said in an interview with Europe's leading newspaper.<mask>His decision sets the stage for Britain to join the 27 - nation union if it is retained.<mask> <p1>'s <p2> said Wednesday that if his party wins its <p3> majority, " Britain should stand firmly in the euro and ensure our future as a European country is assured."<mask> <p0>'s announcement on Thursday comes just one day after Britain's <p4> warned that it will vote on a controversial interim solution to the eurozone debt crisis if Prime Minister fails to win the election in May.<mask>The uncertainty over how to proceed in 2015, uncertainty over Greece's exit from the euro, and uncertainty about future UK policies have led to fears that European leaders may try to get Greece to back out.<mask> <p2> said the UK was " a member of the bloc " and " could vote on its future on its own."<mask>" We need to decide that if this is the last option in our national destiny, then the future of the UK is for us all to have choices, not only on how we live our life, but whether we're willing to act," he said.<mask>But <p0>'s insistence that British exit will be in the best interest of Europe, as the UK and Germany have already done in the past, raised questions about his plans and prompted him to soften his stance.<mask>In the interview with <p1>, <p0> warned : " You are the last country in the <p5> -- but you are in the final phase of Europe now.<mask>And we've got to protect you against the worst case of the political instability that you are facing," he told <p1>.<mask> <p4> warned Britain against the dangers of losing the euro on an already difficult day.<mask>He said if the UK's vote were to be held today, " the consequences of what you have done in your lives and in your political life are probably very severe."<mask>He was referring to an assessment of the risks facing UK national security and <p8>'s handling of its nuclear weapons program, with reports of the British nuclear negotiations going on as planned.<mask> <p8> has called on its members to stick to a 2005 deadline to agree to a deal to limit the amount of nuclear weapons it can stockpile in the West and renegotiate a no - strings agreement with France, if Britain did
<mask>But perhaps it's an idea that is being revived by the inventor of <p0>, and the inventor, <p1>.<mask>The company's new ultra - electric car is due to hit the market in September.<mask> <p4> is being built on an electric engine made from carbon fiber and is expected to be built to the " best " shape.<mask>Inspired by <p2> of the U. K. in the late 1950s, <p0> aims to use its E3 to meet demand for the technology in the electrical industry.<mask>" We're not really working on replacing conventional and hybrid vehicles with a cleaner, more efficient, greener, more reliable and more efficient vehicle," says <p2>.<mask>As part of <p1>'s <p5> program, <p2>'s company has been studying alternatives for E3 on the grid.<mask> <p2> says that while he has been working on alternative, electric cars can offer " a whole new range of uses that are not very far - fetched.<mask> <p7> for a solar car."<mask>The inventor says he's interested in building a car that <p1> could use to save people's lives, but that " is not in practicality."<mask>" There's a whole host of functions.<mask>But what we're interested in is the ability to drive and do what it takes to be able to do that," he told <p6>.<mask>A new, more electric car would also be ideal for the future of green transportation, he adds.<mask> <p0> incorporates a carbon fiber - based battery for its <p8> engine, which is designed to have a functioning lithium - ion battery.<mask>To give users the ability on the road, Â £ 350 ($ 530 ) a month in <p0>'s version of the car.<mask>While <p0> may not be as radical as its rivals, its hybrid models can run on low - power, carbon fiber, glass and plastic and will therefore act as a type of vehicle.

<mask> <p0> predicted between 8 and 12 inches of snow for most of New England, up from 18 inches in Friday.<mask>But in some areas, the cold front will be a far cry from the brutal December storm that killed at least 14 people in the region over the weekend, <p0> meteorologist <p1> said.<mask>Forecasters say a chance of sleet and rain in parts of southern Massachusetts and northern Maine on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.<mask>" If you live in Maine or Maryland, maybe there won't be a winter storm coming in, but you might be able to get it," <p1> told <p2> affiliate <p3>.<mask>New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Philadelphia could see as much as 10 inches of sleaze, he said.
<mask>Inflation has soared in China and the country's currency has risen by as much as 40 % since 2008.<mask>But this has also led to fears of a possible second wave of " China bubble," or bubble tourism, which would lead to a possible global economic slowdown.<mask>The current bubble will likely have zero effect on China's travel industry as the boom begins.<mask>It is also expected to drive demand for Chinese goods, which could lead to an increase in demand for the goods, but could also lead to disruptions to exports.<mask> <p1>, a senior fellow at <p2> at <p3> and author of " The Emerging Economic Prospect," recently said that Chinese consumer demand for luxury travel will only be sustained if the growth continues.<mask>He warned that in the next few years, Chinese domestic travel will begin to become " more crowded and competitive."<mask> <p3>, who specializes in Latin American studies at <p4>, recently spoke to <p5> about what's driving the growing Chinese spending on luxury travel, and why the country needs to be viewed more differently than the United States.<mask>An edited version of that interview follows.<mask>What's the key lesson from China's economic success?<mask>It's that the number of people who spend their leisure time in China is expected to increase by 40 % in the past decade, according to <p2>.<mask>There are already many countries where the number has increased to at least 6 % and this could affect how many tourists are coming into China.<mask>I think that's an important thing for the Chinese consumer because of the massive amounts of people spending on everything from plane tickets to luggage in Beijing.<mask> <p4> is known for its fast - paced demand for raw materials, and in many countries, it is also known for high prices, high demand for imported goods.<mask>In 2009, the Chinese government spent $ 23 billion on domestic travel -- a record in this time, according the report.<mask>Why China's bubble economy isn't just about economics.
<mask> <p0>, 49, of <p1>, was wearing a shirtless shirt with the words, " RIP Sandy."<mask>After spotting him Friday, the two men were pulled from a water rescue vessel on foot and carried from the ocean by rafts.<mask> <p0> was one of two people who died after their rescuers were unable to revive them, <p2>.<mask> <p1> Fire Department Capt.<mask> <p2> said Saturday.<mask>" The first one was actually alive when the rescue vessel went to look for him," <p2> said.<mask>The second was unable to locate his body because he was so immersed in water.<mask> <p5> said they couldn't immediately identify both men because they were unable at first to locate their mother.<mask>In a news release, <p0> remembered a good Samaritan by asking, " Do you know what you can do for this people?"<mask>When he could not, the person who helped him was " in absolute total shock and awe."<mask> <p3> said he reached for <p0>, who was a personal friend of his.<mask> <p6>'s <p7> contributed to this report.
<mask>Maybe a giant lip.<mask>Or a giant heart.<mask> <p0> in a dress, with her hair tied back, and her arms bound with duct tape.<mask>These are all just some of the events at the quirky, but lavish events held in Washington, or at least a few, to the little ones.<mask>At what's known in Washington as " a grand, little party " on Monday, the public will be able to catch a glimpse of them when lawmakers decide on a new, sweeping measure -- known as the " daycare " law -- that is designed to make it easier for children to get to the center of things when they are out of school and out of college.<mask>A small child will be allowed to get a " day care " on his birthday as a <p0> has to work harder than other days, according to lawyers and family experts, who cited a recent study by <p1>.<mask>And, according the <p1> study, " this particular year was spent on the centercare program."<mask> <p2> : What does it take to be a child with mental retardation to get access to the federal system?<mask> <p4> : One of the great experiences as an <p0> parent was a time when children were getting the care they needed to go to school and be there for themselves and their parents.<mask>They were a lot younger than they were to be at school.<mask>" Their parents were at least three times more mature than their parents were to kids in college," said <p7>, director of the school's <p8> and a member of <p9>.<mask>Even though it costs about $ 8 a ticket to attend, children who are 6 or younger have to pay up to $ 3, 400.<mask>That doesn't include spending $ 100, 000 for transportation.<mask> <p1> also points out that, if the federal government adopts the " Daycare " program, children will not be able at least at a home.<mask> <p5>, senior counsel for <p1>, said in an email that the law was " a good way to get some kids to participate in school activities " when the government says that " when they have no idea what they are going to do, they may not be allowed into the public system."
<mask>In addition to the millions of Americans, millions of others around the world will come to civic forums, such as the <p0>. com website, to debate issues of economic inequality, climate change, immigration and public safety.<mask>Voting for citizens by citizens is not just about the voting of citizens, but also about the way we live our lives.<mask>While these elections are a major indicator of the overall representation of the country and to <p0>'s website, what is happening in Washington and around the country is a reflection of the ongoing partisan polarization and the partisan nature of our political discussions.<mask>That is why the Â £ 1. 1 trillion <p0> bill -- the second - largest government bailout legislation in U. S. history -- will pass the <p1> with a simple majority vote.<mask>If the bill passes, it would be the first time a major public health bill has been included in a bill to fund health care.<mask>It would be another historic example of bipartisan legislation that would expand <p7> health care coverage.<mask>In March, the <p4> passed the <p8>, which includes provisions that would allow for a tax hike on those making less than $ 250, 000 a year to help meet rising health care costs.<mask>The bill will now come up for debate again on the November 4th, as well as on a continuing resolution, so long as it is passed with the support of the American people.<mask>There is no better time to celebrate the American way than this election, especially on this critical day for the economy.<mask> <p7> Republicans have the potential to take control of both chambers of <p0>, and if it is approved, the president could sign off on a deal that would increase the number of government workers and provide relief to low - income people suffering from chronic health care premiums.<mask>These bills are supported by <p2>, the bipartisan health care reform law.<mask>But even after the <p9> bill passed, as many as 70 % of Americans continue to suffer from chronic chronic health issues, the most debilitating of which is chronic obstructive sleep apnea.<mask>According to <p6>, the total number of people suffering this form of insomnia dropped from roughly one in four in 2011 to just under one in three in 2013.<mask> <p6> also warns that health care and financial issues are among the most important and urgent challenges facing Americans.<mask>We must work together to find solutions to ensure that we are not distracted by partisan gridlock and broken promises of government spending.
<mask>The deal will bring together companies from the United States and China to take a 70 % stake.<mask> <p0>'s <p1>, a British firm specializing in Internet business, has been under intense pressure from Chinese rivals to scale back its presence in the Chinese market.<mask>" This is a tremendous step forward for <p1> and underscores the determination of Chinese companies to grow their own businesses in cyberspace and beyond," <p0> chairman <p2> told a press conference at <p3>, China's version of <p4>.<mask>Earlier in the week, Chinese <p6> cited " aggressive " efforts by the Chinese government to cut its workforce and address " the significant potential economic impact of a Chinese online company."<mask>The company said the deal would include " a significant return on investment of up to $ 7. 1 billion."<mask> <p3> has already set up another 20 Chinese startups with the goal of boosting sales of the company, while the Chinese venture capital firm <p7> recently acquired stakes in <p8>, a company that <p1> is believed to be seeking to build.<mask> <p5>, <p0>'s co - founder and chairman, told <p9> that the deal was worth " very little."<mask>" <p6> had done an aggressive and aggressive campaign to fight the Chinese takeover.<mask>They have been successful in the United Arab Emirates and in Japan," he said.<mask>But the acquisition could potentially hurt the company's profile in the world.<mask> <p7>'s Chinese competitors such as <p10> and <p11>, which recently took advantage of <p7>'s dominance to launch search and <p12>, have stepped up their efforts to crack down on the Chinese Chinese Internet giant, which accounts for a staggering 86 % of search revenues in China.<mask>The acquisition, which is expected to go for about $ 15 billion, has seen <p11>'s market share dip by 7 % and <p1>'s market capitalization soar by 9 % over the past year.<mask>Opinion : Yahoo takeover of Chinese Internet could be a good thing.<mask> <p11> told <p13> he was " cautiously optimistic " that the agreement would mean that China would be able to gain more access to technology than its American competitors, although he added that the Chinese internet company's ability to deliver information on products and services would not be adversely affected by the deal.
<mask>But in the post - election press conference Thursday he said the United States was " fortunate to be " " blessed " by a president who has delivered the country's first African - American president since <p0> in 1964.<mask>" We have had a very positive president," <p1> said of the " people, their elected leaders, their congressional leaders."<mask>But there's still a lot of work to do before the election to get the president to address the nation and get <p0> back to work.<mask> <p0> : President <p2> needs to get out on top.<mask>The president was a big supporter of his 2008 reelection bid.<mask>He signed a bill that lowered the minimum wage from $ 7. 25 to $ 8. 25 and signed a measure that repealed the <p0> tax cuts in 2001.<mask>But the president isn't giving up on that fight yet.<mask>Republicans won control of both houses of <p2> in November but <p2> didn't finish a majority in the chamber.<mask> <p3>. com : Obama's electoral strategy.<mask>After Obama's re - election, there's little <p3> left to do, said <p4>'s <p5>.<mask> <p4> called <p6> a " distraction " and said he would do whatever it takes to stay the course.<mask>And while some <p3> political analysts were predicting the outcome, <p5> was quick to note there's a long way to go before <p2> can go.<mask> <p8>, a political science professor at <p9> in Atlanta, said the economy could not be sustained by a Republican majority in <p10> if the president continued on his current course.

<mask>I am a Christian.<mask>I worship Christian, and I believe that everything I do is for God.<mask>But there is something different about being a Christian, or being a Muslim that I am not.<mask>The only difference is that I don't believe that God exists.<mask>That I don.<mask>So, as a Christian I have to understand that there is a lot of truth in what God tells me.<mask>Some of my prayers to God, and some of my most fervent followers, aren't quite true.<mask>They are certainly not perfect.<mask>And some are certainly wrong.<mask>Whatever God says to us -- be it a good, compassionate, generous, benevolent, forgiving -- that God has created a space of humility and tolerance for all -- it's always been a question of the moment.<mask>This is why we often consider the " American Muslim."<mask>That is why the first question I had to answer was how do we understand the religious divisiveness and the demonization of the Muslim community in America and the Islamic world?<mask> <p2> to be precise.<mask> <p0> is as spiritual as the American people.<mask>My spiritual leader, <p4>, says that " no person is less pious than <p4>."

<mask>But are they good for jobs?<mask> <p2>'s <p3> says that's a lie.<mask>She's been studying the technology for over 20 years.<mask>" People in the developed world really think they can't have a good driver.<mask>They're afraid they're going to get it.<mask>But we see that they're actually good for the environment -- for the whole human population -- so we think the smart car is best for the job, and for the health, too," she told <p2>.<mask> <p5> car, which will be available later this year, will be the first in the U.

<mask>" We are tired of the government's brutal policy.<mask>We are tired that the people, who are responsible for their lives, are not happy," Morales told a crowd of tens of thousands of people in La Paz, Bolivia, where the announcement was made, according to state - run media <p2>.<mask>" They are tired and hungry for freedom and dignity, and they don't want to change the Bolivian constitution."<mask>The move, called " Plan Colombia," is an effort to encourage direct democracy in Bolivia.<mask>It will end subsidies on gasoline, diesel and oil and is expected to save more money by eliminating the subsidy at the end of the year.<mask>The national price of gasoline has jumped to more than $ 4 a gallon, forcing some Bolivians to buy more gasoline.<mask>Some protests have taken place in cities such as Baraja and La Pada, which have high fuel costs.<mask> <p3> have also taken to the streets, with protesters holding signs and shouting, " Morales Morales!"<mask>The protests have been peaceful, but have prompted violent clashes.<mask>On Monday, Morales announced the end to fuel subsidies and replaced them with new ones that are still in effect.<mask>This move has drawn support from protesters, including <p3> and youth.<mask>At least 29 people were injured in confrontations Thursday in the capital, according doctors.<mask>While most had been sleeping in their cars, the protesters took to the roads, blaming the government for the soaring gasoline cost.<mask>Earlier Thursday, <p2> reported that 30 people were killed during clashes with police and security forces in the city of Pando, Bolivia's capital.<mask>In addition to the deaths, police have detained at least 37 protesters and injured 13 others, the network said.
<mask>But the public will probably never know exactly what happens to the people who made it to the top.<mask> <p5>, <p6>, <p7>, <p8>, <p9>, <p10>, <p11>, <p12> and <p13> have all been ousted.<mask>They will all be found with a massive sum of billions of dollars in assets and millions more in stock prices, and if this is the case, will they return and make money or do nothing about it?<mask>In fact, <p0>, <p4> and <p0> are both examples of how the big money is going to spill over into the tiny pockets of people.<mask>For these three individuals, their fortunes are not very great.<mask>The first time <p1> went public was in the 1990s when it was sold for $ 15. 6 billion in what many saw as a small stock offering.<mask>At that time, the market was set to go in the opposite direction.<mask>How does it compare with today's stock market?<mask>Let's review.<mask> <p4> and Fisberg did not make a profit.<mask> <p0> sold for an estimated $ 24 billion in 2001, and they were reportedly worth $ 3 billion today.<mask> <p1> did not pay for these millions in taxes.<mask>But while <p1>'s $ 23 billion earnings were phenomenal, they were not as much in the same way <p0> earned in the fall and it wasn't clear how much of that money went to the shareholders.<mask>Instead, Â $ 23. 7 billion in net proceeds went to <p0> and its employees over the next two years, according to <p14>.<mask>This year's company closed with about $ 23 million in net profit, but in the first three months of 2013, iced in a little more than $ 2 billion.

<mask>A three - judge panel at Israel's <p0> ruled that prosecutors failed to prove that Liberman lied about his taxes on his holdings, including a multimillion - dollar estate.<mask>The prosecution had accused Liberman of receiving kickbacks from businessmen who ran <p0>, and <p1>, a <p2> confidant, paid bribes to avoid a corruption trial.<mask>But prosecutors said they were unable to prove the former minister's innocence because of an immunity requirement.<mask>After his acquittal, he was given a 10 - year sentence.<mask>Prosecutors had accused <p1> of bribing and twisting senior government officials to get more money than they really wanted.<mask> <p1> was Israeli minister of foreign affairs from 1981 to 2009 and was the <p2>'s minister of state for defense during that time.<mask>He was one of Israel's founding members of <p0> and is considered one of the architects of the Arab Spring.<mask>" The verdict was a blow to Israel's security system as a whole, but it also sends a clear signal that Israeli democracy does not give up," said <p4>, <p5> of <p6>.<mask> <p3>'s <p7> contributed to this report.
<mask>The report by <p0>, headed by <p1> Secretary <p2>, cited a <p3> inspector general's report that concluded there is " widespread fraud " at the VA and that there is a " continuing absence of leadership " in the agency's Phoenix office.<mask>The VA needs to implement its plan to improve patient care and care to " prevent future deaths and to improve the quality of care by addressing systemic issues," the report said.<mask>In addition, the inspector general should recommend an overhaul to the system's medical care system, <p0> said in a letter.<mask>It was not immediately clear what the <p6> will do next in the VA medical care overhaul.<mask> <p0> also said the VA needs new leadership to address rising health care costs and to " ensure accountability and integrity " to its employees.<mask>He proposed a combination of reform as well as changing the culture of <p6> leadership at the medical center.<mask>" At the same time, <p8> must fix the unacceptable lack of leadership at VA," he wrote.<mask>But <p0> acknowledged that shortcomings in the <p9>'s medical system can be addressed but said " it is critical that we take these unacceptable problems and fix them."<mask> <p4> Secretary <p10> will meet with Obama and other top VA officials to discuss the reforms, the report noted.<mask> <p2>'s response noted shortcomings at the <p11>.<mask> <p10>, a former deputy secretary for <p6>, called the <p0> report " a sobering overview of the department's leadership crisis."<mask>He noted the <p3> and the secretary's " inability to act on timely and accountable leadership," but said the <p2> administration needs to step up its efforts " to reach an accountable and patient - centered leadership."<mask>" There has been a significant breakdown in leadership, but we remain shortchanged in the major issues we are facing," Shinseki said in the letter.

<mask>The state has a long list of faults and problems -- from the first one to the strongest one.<mask>But with a strong earthquake, Oklahoma is at the top of the list.<mask>The most damaging this year is a 2011 <p0> -- magnitude 5. 2 -- that experienced a 7. 0 earthquake off the coast of Mule Creek in August, the <p1> said.<mask>That quake destroyed 11 homes, damaged about 900, 000 homes and left nearly 2, 000 people homeless.<mask>A second magnitude quake struck in March.<mask>Another one, this one named <p8>, also hit the state in April.<mask>Oklahoma, with the highest quake season on record, ranks third.<mask>With its strong seismometer and high temperatures in the low 60s, the state has experienced a series of major earthquakes in the past few weeks.<mask>One of those occurred in March, when a huge quake hit the Midwest and killed more than 250 people.<mask>In June, Oklahoma experienced its worst season in more than 20 years, and a month earlier a deadly tornado hit the same state.<mask>It was the strongest recorded year - end on record in the United States, according to <p2>, a seismologist and professor at <p9>.<mask>" Oklahoma is unique in terms of seismic activity," he said.
<mask>The planets -- Titan and Titan -- are part of the solar system's " super telescope " and it's expected to host life for hundreds of years, scientists said Wednesday.<mask>" For the first time in our history, a planet has a solar system that could sustain life in an Earth and a planet on a planetary surface," said <p1>, astronomer at <p2> in Pasadena, California.<mask>The find came during a period of study of the planet's composition, the authors wrote in the October issue of the journal Nature.<mask>These planets -- referred to as planets in the solar systems -- are located roughly 50 light years from Earth -- and the planets are 1. 6 billion light - years away, <p1> said.<mask> <p3> in 1754, Titan, Titan and <p4> are all planets in an early solar system.<mask>In 2005, <p5> and <p6> discovered Titan in the southern ring of a star called <p7>.<mask>Since then, the two <p3> spacecraft have taken the lead in finding Titan's gas and hydrocarbons in solar system collisions.<mask>But they were not successful because they were ejected at an early stage, so they were unable to carry out their missions using a towed probe.<mask> <p4> and Titan are located more than 25 light - days from Earth.<mask>Now they are better equipped than the current <p4> missions to find planets elsewhere in our solar system and support life on Earth.
<mask>The two actors were part of <p0>'s " The Hollywood A - Team " team, and as a result, they're known for being a couple of the best - selling movies of all time.<mask>" We didn't want to create an iconic movie but we knew there was a need for a little more work, so we started building a studio that would come with all the best stuff," <p1> told <p2>'s <p3>.<mask> <p0>, who also starred in the first " Aniston " spinoff in 1992, is the son of actor <p4> and director <p5>.<mask>The duo was cast as well as two other actors.<mask>In addition to being a well - known actress and a leading man in Hollywood, <p4> worked on an independent film.<mask>A relationship with <p5> was a big part of his " A -" movie.<mask>But for <p0>, the focus at the time was on the movie and on <p4>, and they worked to make him a good role model.<mask>They also created a personal relationship when <p0> died in 2003.<mask>While <p0> and <p5> were friends, they had a falling out after the shooting.<mask> <p6> went to rehab in 2009 and underwent surgery for cancer in 2010.<mask> <p1> recalled her first meeting with <p0> as he prepared to go on a shooting spree with him for the film's premiere in Dallas, Texas.<mask>That movie, in which <p8> plays a young woman who has become a part of an elite family in Hollywood.<mask>At first, the pair didn't see eye to eye when they met on set, but, said <p0> later, " they were inseparable."<mask> <p5>, who had just wrapped filming on the first installment, has a close relationship with the star, the actress - director.<mask> <p2> spoke with <p1> about the inspiration for " The Aniston T - shirt," their relationship at the beginning of " The A - team " and the advice <p0> gives <p0> in his memoir, " I'll Be That Friend."
<mask>The reality of Obamacare and politics is not inescapable, especially with millions in the United States now unable to get back on their feet.<mask> <p0> will run out of money next week.<mask> <p1> Speaker <p2> will be faced with a long list of challenges, including how to address the federal government's growing deficit and whether to respond to rising deficits and debt.<mask>" We are faced with the most fundamental problems our country has ever faced : the debt ceiling, our ability to borrow money," he said Sunday.<mask>The debt limit debacle was a key element in the standoff, and even in a lame duck session the government's ability to act could be hit hard by a default by late April.<mask> <p2>'s aides believe the United Kingdom government will not have enough money to pay for the government shutdown and that a default would be inevitable.<mask>That would be the point <p2> has struck when addressing the growing fiscal cliff, which would mean the debt limit would increase to $ 659 billion -- nearly a third of the current current ceiling.<mask> <p3> is not prepared to take any action until after the shutdown ends, the Obama administration has said, citing <p4> and <p5>.<mask> <p6> to move quickly on Obamacare funding.<mask> <p9>.<mask> <p10> said the president needs time to act on his pledge to close the federal budget " and begin the process of implementing reforms that will reduce the deficit," the administration's first senior national security adviser said on Sunday.
<mask>" We are prepared to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we don't want to walk away from it," <p0> said at a joint news briefing with South Korea's <p1>.<mask>" Our best hope is that we get the <p6> to go in and look at our options for talks with North Korea and make that a reality."<mask>" But there's a long time we cannot talk about the denization of Korea.<mask>We cannot talk for a nuclear arsenal, only about the destruction of the North Korean peninsula," " We can't talk for peace and stability at the same time."<mask>South Korean Foreign Minister <p1> said <p0> was " trying to be very clear " about what he thinks the United States can and can't do.<mask> <p7>, however, have expressed concerns about North Korea's continued threats of nuclear weapons.<mask>The United States has imposed a sanctions on North Korea in recent months in an attempt to contain the rising tension on the Korean peninsula.<mask>North Korea has previously said it could not agree to joint U. N.- South Korean efforts to reduce tensions on the peninsula, which is in a flashpoint with the international community.<mask>Last year, <p4> imposed tougher sanctions against North Korea for its nuclear program, including a ban on the production, possession or distribution of uranium in its uranium and that of a South Korean soldier.<mask>Pyongyang has also carried out missile tests, including in March, which were considered an effort to bring its nuclear weapons program to a halt.<mask>In response to that, the North launched two short - range missiles into the sea off its east coast on Thursday.<mask>A senior <p2> official told <p8> last week that the country's planned missile test may have been carried out by an American company, which says it has enough information to make a nuclear weapon.<mask>Earlier this month, South Korea suspended its supply of fresh food after the North said it was nullifying a December agreement to resume importing more food from South Korea, the United Kingdom and the South.<mask>It recalled two of its own citizens after the South returned food from a shipment to North Korea last week.<mask>On Friday, the South Korean foreign ministry said its decision to suspend its supply after the two incidents was linked to a third supplier of food to North Korean ships.

"<mask>As recently as 2002, the <p4> failed to accurately report the harmful effects of CTE ( traumatic brain injury ) and its comprehensiveness in all aspects of its practices, training, and prevention."<mask>Former <p5> defensive end <p6> has been named as a defendant.<mask>He is accused of making false statements to <p9> about the effects he suffered from concussions.<mask> <p3>, who once played for <p0> and for <p10>, is also named as an plaintiff.<mask>According to the Â ¬ 4 million - dollar lawsuit, <p4> has provided <p6> and its lawyers with confidential medical and scientific information, including the number ofussions he suffered, concussion monitoring and other data, which he says is inconsistent with the standard operating procedure for medical care, concussion protection and cognitive and motor skills.<mask> <p10> and <p6> have already served in federal court, including two felony trials.<mask>Attorney <p8>, who was named as <p6>'s defense lawyer in the suit, said the <p9> is confident the lawsuit will be dismissed.<mask>They have been practicing their labor since 1980 and have been paid almost $ 100 million for their services, the suit alleged.<mask>One player, whose name was not disclosed because he is now suing the league, alleged the league concealed his symptoms and the health risks from other players and trainers until the 1920s.<mask>While the plaintiffs said the league has been negligent and liable, they alleged the <p0> hid the dangers and the truth.<mask> <p2> Commissioner <p11> said it has to ensure that players " are fully aware of the health and safety risks associated with concussions."<mask>A spokesman for the <p13> said the firm has been hired by <p1> and is assisting with reviewing the lawsuit.

<mask>The latest spike in gas prices came just days after U. S. prices jumped 40 percent, <p0> says.<mask> <p0> says gas prices have tripled since 2005, when the price of gasoline rose to $ 3 a gallon.<mask>In Mexico, the price has increased so much that it's forced drivers to buy other cars.<mask>That's why people are traveling to Mexico for fun, but also to try to enjoy a free vacation.<mask>" We're here to stay," said <p0>, 40, who plans to return to the United States on Tuesday.<mask>For the last five years, the family has used $ 6. 50 a gallon gas from <p1>, Colorado.<mask>On Tuesday, <p1> was filling up at a gas station in Tucson, Arizona.<mask>It's a great deal, she said, but it's not always the cheapest.<mask>Watch a father tell his son how he can't fussy about gas ».<mask>The <p1> family is spending less on gasoline and purchasing electricity, and that's why they recently had to empty the tank on their new truck because of the hike in gas costs.<mask> <p1>'s convenience store is not the only stop along the way.<mask>Another big trend has been that tank refineries and maintenance sites have grown into makeshift collection places.<mask>A massive, sprawling facility in Michigan that's helping repair roads and bridges is also expanding to Mexico.<mask>Some construction sites are also constructing temporary tankers.<mask>Mexico's GasPrices have soared as high as nearly $ 1 a gallon this week, and officials have raised gasoline prices in the country.

<mask>" I think that if <p0> were a Democrat and president, we would be so proud of him that he could have flown the <p1> plane from Paris, and have done everything in his power to prevent it from landing," the Minnesota congresswoman said Monday.<mask>" Who could have envisioned him that way?"<mask>Her comments, posted on <p2>'s Facebook page, were a sharp dig at a person who piloted the doomed flight to safety and the passengers on board.<mask>On Tuesday, <p9>'s <p10> criticized <p0> for suggesting that the plane had flown too fast.<mask>The <p1> flight's pilot, <p11>, took off from <p12> while en route to Brussels for Paris on July 20 and was en route with 144 passengers and five crew members on board when it disappeared from radar.<mask>According to investigators, O'Hare managed to land safely without the pilot on board, and has since died.<mask>Investigators have said that O'Connor and co - pilot are not fit to fly.<mask>Former Florida congresswoman <p4> said in a statement that the <p5> pilot should not have taken part in the doomed plane.<mask> <p0> replied that she knows how to handle a jet like that, but that, like so many other members of the <p2> family, the flight was to take off, and the person he was supposed to assist is someone who had a lot of experience flying.<mask>But he is the first to admit that the president is too fast when the co - pilots are behind the wheel.<mask>"( <p0> ) said, there is no question of that, and he's been involved in flying for more than two years now, and that's why I have a responsibility to help him," <p4> told <p10>'s <p13>.<mask>"...

<mask>Here are some of the big stories on the topic.<mask>Iran's nuclear negotiations.<mask> <p0> threatened to pull out of China and Iran's nuclear program unless <p1> decided to end its uranium enrichment program.<mask>The nuclear talks are happening in the same country as the Iranian conflict, and while the nuclear negotiations appear to be taking place, there are also tensions in Iran's civil war, which is being fueled by nuclear negotiations between Iran and six other countries.<mask>All of these are serious concerns, but they also come at a time when <p0> is still experimenting with how to handle the international crisis.<mask>What do you think of these rumors, and others like them, about <p0>'s threats?<mask>Do you think this is just another big, bad story, and do you feel <p1>'s security concerns are being checked?<mask> <p6> MASHABLE. com.<mask>How do you trust Google?<mask> <p2> your opinions in the comments.<mask>Let us know in the Sound Off box below.<mask> <p5>. com readers.<mask> <p6>. com download the latest <p7>, photo app and mobile versions of <p8>.<mask> <p9>. com, <p10>. com ; <p11>. com | <p12>.
<mask>The players had already left their training camp and were leaving to watch the game on television.<mask>But two minutes from time they might have found the goal they were desperately seeking.<mask>Their game was in danger of going to penalties, and the referee awarded a second yellow card for bringing down a Mexican goalkeeper.<mask> <p1>, the scorer of the opening goal for Brazil against France in the 2012 Olympic Games, struck the crossbar from outside the penalty area.<mask>There was still time for the referee to speak, and he should.<mask>However, after Mexico's <p2> was sent off for diving, Brazil were given their marching orders and banned from taking part in the World Cup for two years.<mask>In other action on Sunday, <p3> was sent to the stands in protest over his role in the death of former Brazil national team player <p4>, who was the subject of a scathing report on the governing body's disciplinary body.<mask> <p3>'s death was hailed by Brazil's public relations department as the worst ever by a governing body and sparked a nationwide debate over the governing bodies'secrecy over the treatment of players.<mask> <p13> striker <p14> was handed the Confederations Cup for the first time in his career, having also played in the Confederatory Cup in 2010 and 2012, as well as in the 2010 World Cup and 2014 Olympics.<mask>The two other yellow cards were handed out to Argentina, a move which has seen Brazil take the Confederacy Cup to the Confederator Cup in Brazil.<mask>" This result shows the lack of respect that football provides to the governing authorities in the states," <p8> said in a statement.<mask> <p5> was the only striker not awarded a penalty, and <p6> also received the Confederary Gold Cup.<mask>Mexico's players had been suspended for seven games but the referee will continue to be sent off in protest.<mask>It was the fifth time in four years that the national team was allowed to play in Brazil, with no other team in the South American country due to boycott.<mask> <p4>'s death sparked widespread reaction on social media, as a section of Brazil fans took to Twitter, and referred to him as the " man who wrote that the video on Facebook is " <p5>, the man who tweeted it was the " greatest person who ever happened to referee the World Cups.

<mask>The officials, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said <p0> made his private conversation with <p1> about <p2>'s creation of the so - called " Air Defense Identification Zone " and the creation of a military base in the region.<mask>" It is a clear game changer, and we have to ensure China complies," <p0> said to Xi, according to the report.<mask> <p0>'s private conversation was not the first time <p1> has called for talks between the United States and China over the creation, or <p3>, of the zone.<mask>The first two days of <p0>'s visit -- in July and April -- came as China announced the creation and deployment of a new U. S. Air Defense identification zone over several of the islands that it calls the Xisha Islands.<mask>It also announced plans to build a military presence along the contested Paracel and Zhongnanhai islands.<mask>Both the U. N. and Japanese governments recognize the zone as a part of the territory they own.<mask>China says the zone covers a large area of land that covers more than 40, 000 square miles and is subject to numerous U. nautical and air defense identification measures.<mask>In April, <p1> made headlines when he announced that two ships and three planes had entered the disputed waters and were being monitored by <p3>.<mask>That led to international condemnation, with <p0> calling the announcement a " blatant infringement of the freedom of navigation, international law, and human dignity."<mask>But China has insisted the U States is abiding by the <p7> agreement, calling it a violation of the Basic Law.<mask>Earlier this year, China warned that the deployment of ships and planes to the zone could complicate efforts to resolve the dispute.<mask>On Monday, Japan announced the deployment and creation of an airborne defense identification zone.

<mask> <p0> carving up a sieve in a vineyard in New Brunswick.<mask> <p1> taking it on a giant glass of wine.<mask>But what's behind these scenes, and the story behind them, is something that the entrepreneurial <p0> has been keen to do for the last two years.<mask>He's trying to make some changes to his humble business in a West Coast country where the majority of his family lives in rural rural areas.<mask>" It's not for me to create my own business or anything," <p0> says.<mask>Now 27, he works as a <p1> bartender in Chatsworth, New Jersey.<mask>It's an innovative approach to the job that has been thrust onto the international scene in recent years -- and one that has seen <p0> become a household name.<mask> <p5> the <p6> and wine. com first caught up with him at a local bar in Chantilly over the weekend.<mask>From the start, <p1> had never been involved in any sort of wine - making venture, as the <p7> and <p8> of wine producing countries have long worked with each other to develop the business and wine - producing industries.<mask>Since 2000, the global industry has been transformed from " the old West - West collaboration, with the likes of <p2>, to a multi - billion dollar, multi - year partnership."<mask>It is the result that <p10>, president and CEO of <p1>, said would be the right person to run the business.<mask> <p0> is hoping the boom will let <p1> create its own wine - consumption and retail business, which could translate into more lucrative jobs for small businesses in the West.<mask>One of the most impressive developments in recent decades, the <p5> partnership has been built by <p11> and <p12> in New Jersey, and now employs 450 people.<mask>The company also plans to relocate its international operations, from a base in Canada to the country's capital, Brasilia, over the next six years.
<mask>There has been a fundamental shift in outlook, but it is not a panacea.<mask>It is not enough to turn the continent upside down, and it needs to evolve.<mask>The reality is that this change needs to be bold.<mask>African leaders need to seize this opportunity and embrace it -- a time when the majority of African countries are embracing the continent as their first priority.<mask> <p2> : African leaders face challenges.<mask>In January, <p2> President <p3> called for the African continent to be " united and cohesive."<mask>But the reality is this is the only way for the continent to truly challenge the expectations of the majority African countries.<mask>We cannot underestimate the power of Afro - pessimism.<mask>Many African leaders, like the late Nigerian president, have taken heart from the fact that the continent is much smaller than their closest counterparts in size, and its people need more security and self - respect than their continent's neighbors.<mask>What are the key issues in Africa that will be discussed at <p2> in coming weeks?<mask> <p9> is a critical issue in many African countries because of its poverty, lack of political will and lack of infrastructure.<mask>To achieve progress, African leaders must first strengthen the political institutions and political structure, move toward political reform and improve governance.<mask>But, when these efforts fail, the opportunity to progress will become too great for some of the African leaders.<mask>A recent report found that the population of Afrogar ( NDC ) was growing at an alarming rate and that the youth unemployment rate among the African population is now closer to 22 %.<mask>While this growth may not be a major obstacle to progress, it will be significant.
<mask> <p0> is going to see his grandchildren <p1> and <p2> at a private military wedding Friday in Dallas, said spokesman <p3>.<mask>The ceremony will be held in honor of <p1>'s 88th birthday.<mask>" I think <p0> will be a very good husband and a very special father to his grandchildren," <p3> said.<mask>On his first trip to Dallas in 1962, the 41st president received a " big thank you " from the Dallas Morning News and also gave a " little bit of thanks " to his wife, Barbara.<mask> <p0> and daughters <p4> and <p5> were present when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, according to the <p6>.<mask>In addition, he will receive a lifetime achievement award.<mask> <p4> said <p0> would be attending the service at his home in Dallas.<mask>But <p4> said the former president has long wanted to " see his kids."<mask>" He is looking forward to having them as a family, including his grandchildren and grandchildren," she said in a statement issued by <p5>.<mask> <p1> is " looking forward... to spending some time with his grandchildren, looking forward, and looking forward with gratitude to the Almighty God."<mask> <p3> told reporters that she was " deeply disappointed and embarrassed " by her husband's decision to attend <p1>.<mask>She said <p4> had asked for his help, but his schedule had not included her visits to Dallas.
<mask>In the case of Sen. <p0>, this is his game.<mask>As the Republican campaign and <p1> headliners continue to gather across the country to criticize Obama's immigration and immigration policies, <p2> has found a way to outsource false information that could prove devastating to Democrats and independents.<mask> <p2>, while admitting that he doesn't support <p3> but is not against the law ( and also has no desire to be part of the <p1> or <p4> ), is attempting to distract attention away from a debate over whether <p3> should be deported back to Mexico.<mask>With the fact that the United States is a very diverse country and a strong national security force, and the president is facing a major reelection campaign that could put him in the <p4>'s cross hairs, the <p5> ought to know better than anyone.<mask>In addition, this <p0> campaign is attempting, in part, to attack <p6>.<mask>This strategy is a political strategy.<mask> <p0> has been criticized from the right, while some Democrats are pushing for an expansion of <p7> program.<mask>Some Republicans have expressed concern that Obama isn't going to be able to make a big impact.<mask> <p11>, who has been in office for more than 10 years, says : " The president is an important player that we have in the fight against organized crime, and I know that he needs to find a way forward."<mask>The Obama campaign has pointed out that the espousing <p4> values have remained a centerpiece of its campaign, and that Obama hasn't been able to speak to Latino voters for more.<mask>For some political observers, Obama's re - election campaign is more of a strategy than a strategy, and they don't see the issue of <p1> policy as a strategy to challenge <p0>.<mask>Even as the Blitzer Center for Political Research has repeatedly criticized the BI for misleading <p1> voters, it has also argued that Obama is an immigration reform advocate, even pointing out that <p1> and <p0> are also members of the same " Gang of Eight " that have clashed over the course of <p4> history.<mask>Furthermore, <p11> has also said that <p0> should be dealt with as an immigration advocate rather than a political one.<mask> <p8> to <p6>'s baseless accusations, <p0> is also using the threat of deportation as a " weapon of war " to further its argument that the president isn't getting his border security through.
<mask>Some of us are afraid we'll never be able to save our lives.<mask>Some us get pregnant while trying to look attractive to our boyfriend.<mask>Others develop a romantic relationship with someone who is not good at keeping them warm.<mask>And yet we're at a certain point when we're ready to do something.<mask>In fact, we tend to take risks in our lives when we don't know how to do it.<mask>As with many of us, we have our own fear of being attacked, and we don just want to take a chance.<mask> <p1> reports that <p2> has killed 14 people so far this year, including <p3>, the owner of <p4>, that in recent months he has killed more than half the people in a shooting spree in Aurora, Colorado.<mask>Many of the victims are young men with disabilities or even mental illness.<mask> <p2> is one of two dozen gun control advocates and the largest gun control advocacy organization in Colorado. org has been running a <p5> campaign for years in Colorado and Colorado, to raise money and awareness.<mask>There are more than 700 gun control organizations in Colorado, Colorado, Texas and Michigan.<mask> <p8> the list of organizations on its website.<mask>It's part of the organization's " Building Better Colorado."<mask>A recent report by <p4> found that a majority of Colorado gun violence victims are students and graduates of <p9> and the Denver, Colorado - based <p10>.<mask>The <p4> has been reporting that 26 people have died in gun violence from shootings, and the number of cases has been declining for years.<mask> <p7>, gun control advocate and <p8> legal director, said the organization has had the greatest spike in violence since <p2> was founded in 2001.
<mask> <p0> of radical Sunni Islamists overran vast swaths of northern Syria in the first year of a crisis, threatening to disrupt government - sanctioned aid and punish any <p1> regime.<mask>Under President <p2>, rebels have captured parts of Daraa and <p3>.<mask>In <p2>'s home state of Raraa, where the fight against the militants began last year, <p4> said the situation " appears to be escalating."<mask>But opposition activists said government troops had responded in a way they'd been reluctant to do.<mask>The state - run <p3> news agency reported Sunday that the government has deployed 3, 600 additional security forces to the Daraara countryside.<mask> <p8>, director of <p9> in Syria, said the army's ability to provide security has not been undermined by <p10> forces'efforts to seize key towns in the south and southwest.<mask>" What is happening in those areas are difficult to answer.<mask>There are so many people still fighting and trying to flee," <p2> told <p11> in an interview.<mask> <p3> has long been a major problem in Syria because of sectarian violence.<mask>But the problem is that ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, is also carving out its own region along the predominantly Sunni Syrian frontier in Iraq and Syria, <p8> said.<mask>It has recently moved into the northern countryside and suburbs of Dair El - Salaheddin and Hama provinces, but is now out of control in parts of the country, he said.
<mask> <p0> has taken dives from Puget Sound to the ocean for more than a year.<mask>He has been there for almost three decades.<mask>When it comes to diving, he is not disappointed.<mask>" If there are people out there who don't want to dive, they're too scared to do it," Woodside said.<mask> <p3> is illegal in the U. S. and Canada and is an endangered species.<mask> <p2> in Seattle, Washington, is a solution that has saved tens of thousands of dollars of fishing nets.<mask>Since 2000, <p3> has saved more than $ 200 million to save wildlife and bring the creatures to surface.<mask>With many of his clients and thousands of volunteers involved in the effort, the department has found a lot more money to be paid for.<mask>Under <p0>, about 20, 000 people are expected to participate in a $ 4 million annual program called <p3>.<mask>Watch how more nets are saving endangered wildlife ».<mask>In order to make a profit from these programs, <p2> has provided nets and other habitat for nearly 500 boats.<mask>The nets are baited onto a deep blue sea about 20 miles underwater.<mask>They are removed when a boat reaches the bottom of the water, and the nets can be removed once the boat reaches deeper underwater, said <p7>, the director of <p3> in Washington.<mask> <p8>, they are used in the evacuation of the Gulf of Mexico and to provide recreational boats with access to water, food and other amenities.<mask> <p5> <p3>'s <p9> and <p10> contributed to this report.
<mask>" We believe that our work will not be finished if this is not a Christian church," said <p0>, bishop of St. Peter's Cathedral in Indianapolis.<mask>" It's a church that believes that if you find God, you will find God and that God will ultimately love you, and that you will not only love <p1>, but that you'll find God teaching you to be apostles of God."<mask>The measure that was approved at the convention by <p1> -- <p2>, <p3> -- marks the first time in nearly 30 years that the church has granted blessing to same - sex couples.<mask>The New Year's resolution includes a ban on " blessings of the same dignity or faith " for same - gender couples.

<mask>Military records provide a variety of information about service members before and after retirement.<mask> <p1> Secretary <p2> announced the creation of the new system for updating records related to service members who left their posts during their service.<mask>" My personnel records provide thousands of valuable information about servicemen and women, and they help us keep up with the latest information about our troops and their careers," <p0> said.<mask>In a statement announcing the new measure, <p3> said, " While servicemen who are not service members are expected to receive the same level of care as their service members, we have a responsibility to act quickly to make sure they are in the best position to fill out a properly required report when they return to duty," according to the president.<mask>The new system will provide details about service member records to be shared with the federal government.<mask>It will also provide recommendations to <p1> Secretary about how they can make changes to service member medical records.<mask>See the records related in detail ».<mask>Previously, <p1> has said it would develop a " comprehensive and accurate " system to determine if records would be useful in any way for such records.
<mask>The executions occurred last week, after <p0> upheld a decision by the Gambian high court to postpone the execution of three men convicted in the 2007 bombings of a university in central Gambia, killing four and injuring 40 others.<mask> <p0> announced it will release its decision to postpone executions of four convicts.<mask>It has imposed a moratorium on the execution for 14 months.<mask> <p1> had requested to stop the executions because <p0> was not able to find another country to take the inmates.<mask>The United States has said Gambia is one of the few countries in the world to abolish death row.<mask>But Gambia has also imposed a death sentence on three other convicts convicted of similar crimes in 2007, the group said.<mask>In the latest execution, <p0> said it planned to issue another ruling on Monday.<mask>" In the meantime, we will continue to seek to ensure that justice is carried out in all manner in all circumstances.<mask>We are continuing to work with Gambian authorities and our partners to work on reducing the death sentences," said the group in a statement.<mask>After the convictions, <p1> was sentenced to death for the bombing of a school in the northern town of <p2>, killing 17 students.<mask>He was also convicted of killing two policemen.<mask> <p8> condemned Gambia's execution Monday.
<mask>Not quite.<mask>But two men and one woman from Africa -- one from the Democratic Republic of Congo, one from Ivory Coast -- are leading a campaign to change that.<mask>The man is <p0>, a former top official in <p1> and the chairman of the women's fashion advisory body <p2>, which oversees <p3>.<mask>" We have heard from the heads of many women in Africa over the past few years who are convinced the new face of women's clothing is a threat to the future of the global image of women," the chairman said in a statement Tuesday, referring to the exhibition, called <p1>'s <p4>.<mask>As he proceeds his work in Africa, <p1>, who works for the fashion company <p5>, will be involved in further studies on the effects of the effects women make on their bodies and on the lives of the children.<mask>His colleagues say the images of <p4>'s naked body are an opportunity to change the attitude about women's health in Africa.<mask> <p5> and <p0> were joined by other women in the media and on social media to launch the women - themed exhibition called " Africa in Africa."<mask> <p7>, the president of <p8> and <p9>, said : " We have seen the negative effects on the image of our country and our community in many African countries.<mask>We don't expect an exhibition to come up with any significant <p9> views."<mask>The exhibition, named " Femme Fatale," will run from August 15 to 18 and will feature three exhibition galleries in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia -- <p7>, <p10> and <p11>.<mask> <p11>, who is also the head of the foundation, said the women in <p4> " are all very happy to be working to create this exhibition and it is really a unique event."<mask> <p8> has been working with the U. N. women's education and awareness organization on the project for several years, and he says the pair are committed to improving the education and training of women in their respective fields.<mask>There is also a campaign for " Afro - Malay Awareness and Global Gender Gap in Africa," which will be held throughout April.<mask>What the men and women in South Africa hope will have the effect of changing the attitudes of women is a debate that is already moving into the national consciousness.<mask>In the last few months the <p12> has issued a statement to clarify that the exhibition is not intended to cause " racial tension " and to promote women's equality.
<mask>I was an international mom in Europe and worked at a medical school in Japan for over six years and felt an obligation to learn more.<mask>Then, <p5> and Dr. <p6>, who's now in the <p7>'s <p8>, decided to launch an online database for children with EV - D68.<mask>I collected a list of school children with enterovirus D68 -- which is technically an EV - 68 -- and posted it online.<mask>You can now visit the database, which includes the names of the hospital and school children in the country ; the <p2>, the clinic where the school is located ; the company that's testing a child with EV68 ; the school that's working with the children ; the hospital in the United States ; the medical school that manufactures and manufactures EV -D68 ; and the hospital's facility in Japan.<mask>" We are looking for a parent who might want to have a child who might not want to share this information about this child because it could cause harm and confusion for others," said <p2> Director Dr. Kent Bracewatch.<mask>The disease also infects children in Japan, as well as in the Middle East.<mask>Eighty - three million children die from EV - d68 each year.<mask>We're the biggest exporter of enteroviruses, and we're going to need to look at other pediatric illnesses and identify the kinds of diseases that are in their control : pneumonia, severe pneumonia and diarrhea.<mask> <p1> says that as EV - - D69 grows, so do children with asthma.<mask>In this age of pandemic viruses, these children have a choice : They can get their airways shut down or face lifelong exposure to the disease.<mask>And as children grow older, there's a chance they will develop respiratory disease later in life.<mask>Emotional health is the prime cause of many child deaths.<mask>That makes it a logical step to share information about these illnesses with a more widespread public discussion, with children especially at the forefront of the debate over how best to protect their health.<mask>Many parents see the social implications of this information as alarming, but they're worried that this information will lead to an increase in the likelihood of children becoming ill.<mask>There's a great deal of research at <p1> to find out more about what is wrong with this disease.
<mask>As it is, however, <p0> remains keen to tackle the challenges posed by the current global economic crisis.<mask>This week the UK government unveiled plans to boost the retirement age of some 6 - to 10 years, while the euro will be one of the highest of European nations.<mask>It is hoped the efforts to lower the financial burden on youth will encourage them to stay focused on their studies and work, and to contribute to making a strong global economy.<mask>While the UK's youth unemployment levels were measured by data from the latest EIU survey, trends continue.<mask> <p1>'s job cuts, along with cuts in services to other sectors, have resulted in a rise in youth unemployment rates of 35 %.<mask>About 50 % of jobless adults aged between 25 and 40 are currently in higher education, and the percentage is rising.<mask>The government's targets for the next 20 years are to increase the jobless rate by 15 % to 25 %, which is now nearly double the government's target of 2. 5 %.
<mask>" What we found was that dispersant is significantly less toxic in the primary application of dispersants than existing products," <p0> <p1> said in a statement released Friday.<mask>" This means that the less - toxic mixture is being tested in the more orderly fashion and has a higher concentrations than existing dispersant that are being tested daily," <p1> added.<mask>The <p1> noted the results were made available on Monday and Monday by the <p2> and <p3>, which used three different compounds, including phencyclidine ( MCHD ) and sibilantromine ( sib ).<mask>The results were released by <p5>.<mask> <p2> said in its statement that its tests also found lower levels of chromium, a type of dispersant used for the oil spill, than in other products and that the <p6> used the main dispersant as a protective measure.<mask>It noted the difference between the two products is less than one year.<mask> <p4>, an <p6> official, said <p6> had used the chemical in the dispersant on a 20 - year - old boy who died after a long environmental battle with asthma.<mask>After a five - day effort, the boy was hospitalized and died of his inhalation.<mask>He also was injected with a tablet of QTAP, a polyglycol ether used to remove oil from the sea, after the boy's death.<mask>According to <p2>, the oil that has been spewing since the disaster was discovered has evaporated in a well since it exploded April 20.<mask> <p7> <p8>, however, cautioned that " it is very difficult to see that all the different products are having an effect on this population."<mask> <p3> used the dispersants on the April 19 explosion of <p9>, the 2011 Exxon Valdez oil spill.<mask> <p3> said it was using QTIP to prevent the blast.<mask> <p8> said that because of the toxic material it poses no health risks because the company uses MCHd for its use on humans.<mask>But while oil and gas companies have said the product is safe, some environmentalists have questioned why <p11> doesn't have the proper resources to use it on humans in the aftermath of the spill.
<mask> <p0>, the judge, said she thought <p1> would take a drink or a sleeping pill while talking to <p1>, who has pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting.<mask>The judge also said <p1> was " so angry and wanted to kill her " that he did not " want to talk to her."<mask>In her testimony Monday, <p1> also complained to Steenkamp that he wanted to talk with her " because I thought I didn't want to have any conversations with him " and that " the two are not friends," the judge said.<mask> <p2>, the double amputee track star, faces a charge of premeditated murder for killing Steenrode Steenberg, 27.<mask>But she is also charged with three other counts, including premeditation, aggravated assault and failure to comply with a lawful order to drop a firearm on <p0>.<mask>Prosecutors have said he mistook her for an intruder in the bathroom of his home in Pretoria for a burglar.<mask> <p3>, who is the second person to testify against <p1> in the trial, also was called by the defense to testify, his legal assistant <p4> told the court.<mask> <p1> has denied that he thought the bathroom door was an open ; he has admitted shooting the woman in his house in February 2013.<mask>He says he mistached the door after he heard loud noises inside the house, but prosecutors say he mistapped his girlfriend when he realized she was in it.<mask>In the days leading up to the shooting, Steenorius'family has argued that he was protecting his girlfriend, saying that he mistreats her when she cries.<mask>On Monday, he called her " a very, very special girl " who was " very courageous," he said.
<mask>The president landed in Buenos Aires on Saturday and did not attend a funeral Mass or hold public events afterward, according to her office.<mask>But government ministers and the head of the ruling <p1>, who is also known as <p2>, made an announcement via Twitter that a memorial service would be held for the president at <p3> in Buenos Angeles, California.<mask>It was the first time the president had attended an event since the last time she attended the presidential inauguration.<mask>She said it was important to focus on the people who are suffering economically, and not the president.<mask>" Our nation needs economic growth and a better government," she said in a statement.<mask>Without a public announcement, the president has been out of the public eye since March, when she said she wanted to focus more on economic matters.<mask>The political crisis has affected many <p2> members.<mask>Her husband, former Argentinian President <p3>, who lost a presidential bid in 2010, and <p4>, president of <p5>, resigned in July amid allegations that they were politically motivated.<mask>At the time of her resignation, more than 90 % of Argentina's population was under a jobless watch.
<mask>" I was trying to defend myself," <p0> said.<mask> <p0>, who spent the last three years of his life in prison, was convicted in 2004 of using performance - enhancing drugs, a charge he vigorously denied, and later admitted to federal prosecutors.<mask>He faced a maximum sentence of four years in prison.<mask>A jury of eight jurors indicted <p0> on six counts of drug possession.<mask>On a second - degree charge, <p0>'s defense team argued in his 2005 testimony that <p1> had deliberately misled <p0> about a potential use of steroids.<mask>In a response to the committee's decision to indict <p0>, <p2> said the jury had " been swayed by the fact that there are no more senior members of the jury than the one sitting on the jury."<mask> <p2>'s response to <p0> was one of several examples of defendants, including former <p3> pitcher <p4>, who successfully sued the government for defamation and a defamation lawsuit, but it remains to be seen whether <p0> will become a hero for the <p5> community after his conviction.<mask>But while there have been a number of individuals, whether in the past two decades or multiple decades, the impact of steroids in sports has been minimal, says <p2>.<mask>And despite the scandals, a vast majority of sportsmen, both professional and professional, believe the use of performance - enhancement drugs is illegal, according to a 2011 study by <p5>.<mask>The study was written in a syndicated " steroid medicine " journal, which was published in 1998, by a group of five men and six women who also sought testing.<mask>Most of the tested men said they had knowingly used steroids, although most have been tested for <p1>, a drug commonly associated with a man's heart disease.<mask>Several others testified, in part because of the fear that their lives could be saved if they also tested positive for the drug.<mask>Many of the other defendants contended that <p3> and <p4> were using steroids because the <p6> allowed them to get steroids.
<mask>The men, who were from the Netherlands, were detained by police, Belize police spokesman <p0> told <p1> Sunday.<mask>Police said they had no information on their source of the alleged killing, and <p1> would not confirm that they knew of the arrest.<mask> <p1>, in a statement issued earlier Sunday, said the two men were involved in a " serious domestic disturbance."<mask>They have been charged with assault, possession of a firearm in the commission of violence, kidnapping and sexual assault, according to <p2> affiliate <p3>.<mask>They had not been arrested in the past, <p3> reported.<mask>After Faull's death Friday, <p1>'s family had said he had been missing since April 15, when authorities said they'd found his body in a shallow grave in his home.<mask>A neighbor of McAfee, who lives near the Faule residence, said in a telephone interview that her neighbor had been " under the influence of methamphetamine."<mask>She said she had been awakened to find her neighbor dead.<mask>" I was scared because he was there," she said.<mask>She then rushed her to the local hospital, where she was pronounced dead, Faulli said.
<mask>The news touched his nerves and created even more questions about how students, educators and even schools could learn about the diverse diversity of the school's students.<mask>" I'm a very, very, enthusiastic person," <p1> said after his announcement on Friday.<mask>But that doesn't mean the freshman leader's new <p2> uniform will be his anymore.<mask>He will be required to follow the campus's policies and procedures on diversity, and the student body will be able to take action on their own, said <p2> spokeswoman <p3>.<mask> <p3> said the president will be asked to follow university procedures.<mask>Students will be told to follow <p12>, <p2> code and learn how to join the school website.<mask>In addition to diversity, students can take the entire campus at <p8> or the entire city.<mask>It's also possible that they can join the group online or on <p3>, who has already done so.<mask> <p4>, the superintendent of <p13>, said the university wants to make sure the diversity of its student population is " paramount."<mask>" They have to be conscious of their community and not allow for personal or political controversy," she said.<mask>That may include a large group of <p7> students in a downtown Fresno city hall.<mask>There's even a student body leader at the Fresno State campus who has said he's " very proud of the students that we represent."<mask>That diversity is a reflection of the diversity and diversity in the university community.<mask>People like <p4>, a member of the <p14>, have said she's proud of what she's done for the university.<mask>She said she started a nonprofit group in the spring to help undocumented students and the <p4> family.
<mask>You may not be mad anymore.<mask> <p1> will hold a live webcast Wednesday night in which the " best of " performers will perform in an unusual show, " Q & A," from the <p2> series.<mask>That show will be on an 8 - hour live web version of " Q2."<mask> <p2> : Q2 cancels.<mask>What's your biggest frustration about the show?<mask>Q : I'd like to remind you of the " worst of the worst " moments?<mask>A : I want to remind everyone that I think every minute of the show is a huge accomplishment.<mask>We're the world's leading television network, so it was amazing to find out about this new technology, which just went live in March, that is, my breakthrough <p0>.<mask>But it also went in with the show, which is an amazing achievement, so I think I needed to take some time off to reflect on the show.<mask>Qatar, like other major countries, is one of the least watched TV networks in the world.<mask>I had to cancel the entire show just a couple of years ago because I didn't want to do anything I could do to bring about the issue of what's right and wrong in the economy.<mask>The other two networks were also terrible for me.<mask>And so I lost my job, and my job and my ability to make an impact in the industry, and then, and unfortunately, they ended up losing their positions on <p6> and <p7> and the <p8>, which were canceled because they weren't going to get the full time job back.<mask>Plus, they weren even going to air the show in this new economy.
<mask>The company is giving a major push to a group of privacy lawyers who are challenging privacy concerns, and the company will ask them to take concrete action to address privacy concerns at its own <p0> meeting this week.<mask>This week, the lawyers brought <p2> to a demonstration of their complaint, filed by a former employee who has brought the issue to the attention of the public for many months.<mask>In the interim, they will be asked to raise questions about privacy at <p3>.<mask>The lawyer is asking <p0> to take immediate action to guard against such requests.<mask>He said <p0> should come up with concrete plans for how to enforce privacy rules on products such as Google I - Report and <p4>.<mask> <p5> told the two - hour meeting they are studying the " different approaches that we use " to protect our privacy.<mask>Many <p3> users are concerned that the lack of <p4> controls could lead to consumer confusion and privacy - related abuse.<mask>One recent <p3> user shared a conversation about privacy with <p2>'s <p6> in which he, too, told a Google engineer how he used his phone and how he collected personal information.<mask>" I didn't want to have the entire conversation about personal information in my home computer," <p5> said.<mask> <p11>, Google <p3> director of product strategy and external security, expressed his concern about privacy in a press conference on Tuesday.<mask>After a long and careful discussion, he said, the company has " learned from the experience that consumers have a tendency to think about things that matter."<mask>When asked whether he wanted to raise privacy concerns among current employees, he responded that he doesn't want them to think anything about their privacy.
<mask> <p0>, <p1>, <p2>, <p3> and <p4> have all written up their city plans and visions.<mask>And when <p1> and <p2> are looking to change their plans, they don't need a car.<mask> <p2> is a smart city.<mask>It offers three suggestions : a smart transportation planning system for a city, which is less expensive and less efficient than a city in its own right, and a city planning system that can be described as " green."<mask> <p4>, <p5>, <p0> and <p1> are pioneers in design, architecture and public planning.<mask>Their most powerful tools are the Smart City concept, which combines the newest technologies and techniques.<mask> <p5>, the company's senior vice president of marketing, is a self - taught architect who is also a self confessed green guy.<mask>" I've got lots of good suggestions, but what really matters is if you're a good advocate for the sustainability of cities," she said.<mask>The idea was to build a city that could change every way we go.<mask> <p6>, the founder of <p7>, and <p8>, a member of <p9>, have designed some of the city's most iconic buildings.<mask>They're both examples of smart cities -- from airports to public transportation systems to the high - tech housing and parks -- that people can learn about and use.<mask> <p7> is built primarily of green design, and it has several elements that are also used in designing cities : the street and sidewalk ; the downtown cabaret ; the shopping and dining venues ; the high end hotels ; and the hotels.<mask> <p1> also wanted to create a hybrid between the city and <p9> that works in other disciplines, and to create an environment that is " more economical and cleaner."<mask> <p13> : What do you have planned for your city?<mask> <p1> : I don't plan to have one yet.
<mask>The plane, which was flying in Australia and Japan for two days and one hour, will go from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Boston, Massachusetts, the <p0> says.<mask> <p3>, a U. S. air safety official who is familiar with the plane's schedule, said the flight is scheduled to take off from Newark, New Jersey.<mask>There is no indication of an explosion on the aircraft, but the plane experienced an " inoperative " or mechanical problem in an inspection of the plane.<mask>A <p1> analysis shows no indications of a burning onboard fuel tank.<mask>The aircraft has been flying since April 2013 and was designed to fly in and out of Boston, <p2> and Japan without any major modifications.<mask>" It's been a long time since our planes have been flown in a safe environment, but this is the first time we have had this happen," Morrell said.<mask> <p4> spokeswoman <p5> said Tuesday that the <p1> does not yet know what prompted <p6> to issue the temporary flight restriction.<mask>In January, the United States grounded the Dreamliner for an unknown reason after the battery system's battery systems detected a potential fire on a <p1> 787 Dreamliner flight in Japan.<mask>That prompted an international investigation, which grounded the plane for several days after a fire aboard a cargo plane in Japan, killing all 49 passengers aboard.<mask>Related : 787s to get new battery system.<mask> <p9> : <p0> uses Dreamliner to fire warning shots.<mask>On Wednesday, an international aircraft manufacturer said it would not make any changes to the Dreamliners unless the aircraft manufacturer is fully satisfied with the response to the development and grounding of its planes.<mask> <p5> said the firm has not received any documentation from <p1> or the <p2> regarding modifications, and she declined to comment on whether the firm is ready to fold the plane back into use.<mask> <p1> spokesman <p10> said the company's Dreamliner program will be " run by a pilot who knows the airline best, and has provided us with the best safety advice."<mask>In February, <p7> ordered the Dream aircraft to be grounded after <p2> said the plane appeared to overheating during a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles.
<mask>She started filming the series as early as 6 a. m. Saturday and is gearing up for another pregnancy, <p0> said.<mask>" She's going to be feeling great," <p0> told <p1>.<mask>The news comes on the heels of the launch of " Snooki," the show in which she and her husband, musician Cliff Huxtable, appear once again together.<mask> <p0> announced her pregnancy on <p2> on Monday.<mask>It's the latest in a series in which the couple have made a series of bizarre headlines as she battled drug addiction and the <p3> series'oversight.<mask>A video of <p4> and <p5>'s relationship became public this year after she posted a picture of a tattoo on her arm that appeared to be <p6>, one of <p7> favorite tattoo artists.<mask>There have been many critics who questioned why <p0> chose to put an end to her relationship with <p5> and has called it her " favorite day of her life."<mask>The reality show has featured more than 100 guest stars, many of whom appeared in a handful of reality shows.<mask>Many of <p0>'s fans have praised the series for the focus on her family and whether the actor is an alcoholic or drug addict.<mask>According to People magazine, which first published a story about <p0>, <p4> said her relationship was " one of the most difficult in my life."
<mask> <p0> Speaker <p1>, left, and <p2> Speaker <p2> pose for a photo in 2006.<mask>The answer to that question seems like a political science fiction.<mask>On Monday, <p0> Republicans met to discuss a bill to fund <p3>, the government health insurance program currently in place in Cuba.<mask> <p1> and <p0> Speaker Hamid <p2> are expected to convene a conference on the issue, and Obama is expected to speak with them before the full session is over.<mask>If they do, they will have a shot at confirming his administration's commitment to the program and the long - term viability of the program.<mask> <p4> members are scheduled to discuss the details in closed sessions Friday.<mask> <p5> Democratic leadership and members of <p6> are expected together to discuss its long - held commitment to ending the program, and their plan will include both a short - term commitment and the short - lived goal of providing insurance coverage for the cost of the vaccine.<mask>A <p2> statement, released after the meeting, said the president and members are confident they can reach a consensus on the short version of the bill.<mask>" We have always believed the administration has the authority to do whatever it wants, but so the long term commitment is not as strong as it seems," said <p7>, a spokesman for <p8>.<mask> <p10>, however, have indicated they may not be serious about implementing any program beyond the short term.<mask> <p3>, they said, is about " spending the money that we do in the short run to reduce the deficit."<mask>" Members have been vocal about their belief that we have the ability to do the right thing, including reducing the deficit and cutting spending and reducing the size of government," <p1> said.<mask>He acknowledged the problems with the program when asked to comment on the " short - run " proposal.<mask>However, <p10> said, " We can't do it just because there is a short stay on this."<mask> <p0> Republicans are also trying to figure out the long run cost of what the <p2> is offering -- a government takeover of health care.
<mask>It's not because we have anything to lose.<mask>But there is a new breed of <p0> -- those who have been outgrew <p1> and who fear losing control of their institutions, the most powerful of which is the <p2>, and that's the new <p3>.<mask>Now, the <p0> is inching toward the presidency -- it's the economy, stupid, stupid.<mask>As one man wrote in an op - ed for the Atlantic this week, " It's not the economy anymore."<mask>" We're tired of the whole thing, and our priorities are stupid."<mask>This sentiment echoes one of the many, many who felt the same way last year after the fall of <p1>.<mask> <p5> of the <p6> was quoted as saying that Egyptians had suffered " a great deal of destruction " from the military " because of the manipulation of the public purse by the <p3>."<mask>That perception of corruption -- the " inability of the Egyptian people to understand the world and the nature of their own government -- became increasingly common during the post - Hosni period, the first six months of 2011, when <p0> was in power.<mask> <p7> media also reported that Egyptians were becoming more accepting of the rule of law, which the government was expected to embrace during the presidential elections.<mask>Yet the perception of a free - market situation in Egypt hasn't changed since then.<mask>The economy's leaders, <p7> Minister <p8> and other politicians all have said that the state is benefiting from the popular vote of the general public.<mask>That has been the case since the January 11 ouster of former president <p7>.<mask> <p8> said that in order to maintain stability in Egypt, the public needed to be able to move from the current situation, where people are choosing their own political futures, to those in positions where there are legitimate and necessary options.<mask>Since <p0> took power, people have come out to ask : What is a revolution?<mask> <p8> has said he has no idea.

<mask>How would you react if doctors told you you'd have to treat yourself?<mask> <p0>, a clinical professor of psychiatry at <p1>, says doctors are often telling you you don't have to go through this.<mask>She said they want you to see them sooner and that you'd be in good shape for the treatments.<mask>Now imagine that you've been told you're going to need surgery -- that you're having a terrible time -- and that your options are out of your reach.<mask>In fact, doctors are telling you there's no way you can save your life -- that it's an insurance policy, that you will need surgery, that your life has shifted.<mask> <p7> your doctors -- just wait.<mask> <p5> are making the case that they are manipulating your medical decisions, that's what they want, and they can't change you.<mask>And according to a recent study in <p1> at <p8>, the number of procedures performed on patients over a given time can reach up to 20, 000.<mask>Researchers estimate that roughly 35 percent of these procedures, called either routine or aggressive, involve a patient.<mask> <p0> warns of aggressive or aggressive treatments.
<mask> <p0> was " really drunk," <p1> says, adding that she had " lost confidence."<mask> <p1>, whose memoir is published Thursday, details her conversations with <p2>.<mask> <p1> says she was drinking and had dinner with <p0> and <p3> at the <p4> hotel in Dallas, Texas.<mask>" There was a wine bubble, you know, that was not a wine bubbling over," " I told him, <p1>, and <p5>.<mask>We had wine in the mornings.<mask>And I was drinking wine, I had a glass of wine, and I told her,'What did I say?'<mask>And she told me,'You have a glass to drink, but don't do that,' " she writes.<mask>While there, " We were having breakfast and I suggested she and I would just go and get some beer," <p0> writes. "<mask>She said,'I would rather let her get out, I would rather be at the hotel with my husband.'<mask>" " I said,'You know what, I've already drank four drinks.<mask>I've had three drinks ; I'd had three glasses of wine,' " <p0> says.<mask>She then suggested she use a lighter to concentrate her energy.<mask>But a drink -- a concoction of coffee, sugar and chocolate -- had a stronger side to it.<mask>The former first lady told King she didn't remember drinking because " it was too late for me to make a decision."<mask>" I was the last to get out of the car.

<mask>The sentence for <p0> was reduced by a judge Friday, the state <p1> said.<mask> <p1> officials announced the changes in court after a typo in the sentence -- in which <p0>, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to possessing 250 grams of cocaine and was convicted of distributing the drug paraphernalia -- was found guilty Friday morning in a Columbus, Ohio, court.<mask>The <p5> noted that <p0>'s sentence stemmed from his 2006 plea deal with another drug offender, <p6>, a convicted felon.<mask> <p6> was sentenced to time served in a separate prison sentence for his 2008 conviction of distributing cocaine and marijuana.<mask>" Today, our state allows <p6> to plead guilty in exchange for his sentence reduced by the sentence imposed in this case," said <p1>.<mask> <p2> <mask> <p2>'s <p7> contributed to this report.
<mask>It's also time to reassess how these animals are being killed and where they're being injured.<mask>We have seen this in the United States as a result of wildlife exploitation in the past.<mask>And we know this is happening in the U. S. when we are trying to protect the wildlife of the Arctic and sea lions.<mask>When we are in need of protection to protect our oceans, we need to protect them.<mask>As <p4> recently pointed out, " the sea lions depend on the <p5> and the Atlantic to eat seals, grizzly bears and other marine mammals, the <p6> and the Cape Cod.<mask>So we need this Marine mammal population to feed on their undersized, undersized and undersized mouths.<mask>The ocean's population is likely to be much smaller than our coral population."<mask>But this population will continue to grow, because the marine mammals are dependent on these marine life as well as the coastal environment.<mask>These animals are threatened with extinction and are frequently overlooked for the United Kingdom.<mask>In addition to the sea lion population, a large number of sea lions live in coastal areas and are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<mask>If the sea turtle population is protected, the wildlife could survive this catastrophe.<mask>I urge the president to encourage conservation efforts at the federal, state and local levels to protect these marine mammals and those who depend on them.

<mask>It makes us believe there is something about our nation -- a place where the power brokers and the politicians are at each other's throats and, in the case of President <p0>, a collective power.<mask>We see an uneasy, decaying government -- one that seemed almost designed to keep us safe from attack.<mask>It's a presidency defined by a constant struggle and a deep sense of injustice that echoes every political defeat -- not to mention, the <p4> presidency, the Vietnam War, the War of Independence, the Soviet Union.<mask>But " Our Nixon " also underscores the power struggles that <p2> had to confront : He was the president whose policies had been more unpopular than the Republicans had hoped ; the president who, in doing so, was also an increasingly unpopular figure.<mask>Here are five key points that we take away from " Our <p0>."<mask>1.<mask> <p3> : What we learned about <p0> during his impeachment, the very presidency that brought him power?<mask>" <p5> : Our Nixon," he told the historians, was the one that allowed us to see the " power brokers," not the people who worked for him.<mask> <p4>, " Our President " was the most well - known of the <p6> administration's leaders, which <p2> helped set up to help make the impeachment process more transparent.<mask>The <p0> administration also knew it was in violation of campaign finance laws, and in many cases <p2> chose to prosecute Americans for tax evasion.<mask> <p12> your reaction.<mask>2.<mask> <p5> knew <p5> was a prickly man.<mask>He never tried to have any relations with <p4>, and there was no doubt that he didn't want to be compared to him.

<mask>But I was blown away by how different the presentations were -- and how many people cared about the issues -- and to how they resonated.<mask>I asked <p0>, the Nobel laureate who has championed an approach to reducing inequality by 2015, what I would like to ask our audience to do differently.<mask> <p1> was right, we were a truly global discussion, with more than a billion members from more than 200 countries.<mask>It wasn't an easy process.<mask> <p0> said she'd never discussed women's rights -- but she would go on to talk about how we have to empower and empower our children and make them more productive and valued.<mask>" A generation of women is more empowered and more empowered.<mask>And I think it's important that we do that by strengthening our institutions and by making them accountable to our communities," she told <p4>.<mask>Why aren't you speaking?<mask>That's a question I will address on April 1, 2015.<mask>What you should know about gender inequality is the discussion has not gotten any more crowded, with new voices -- in this case the speaker -- coming in from around the world speaking at a time when we're all feeling excluded and underrepresented.<mask>To understand the debate, I have to start with why.<mask>If we talk about it for years, we should be asking ourselves how much we have done.<mask> <p11>, I think the answer to this question is simple : No one is going to do it, even if we're both very rich.<mask>The question is how many of us are actually working on the solution.<mask>So the first step is to talk to individuals with backgrounds that are similar or different from us.
<mask>While the stakes are higher than they were a year ago, Republicans need to raise their stakes to convince the public they will be successful in their quest to block President <p0> signature domestic achievement, an issue that is dominating the presidential campaign.<mask>In an interview with <p1> on Monday, <p0> acknowledged that while Republicans had privately been trying to counter the President's signature domestic accomplishment, they lacked the political stamina to overcome their losses.<mask> <p1> : Read more on Obama's battle to defund Obamacare.<mask> <p2> has been a huge focus throughout the entire campaign, and has frequently seen the president and his political team's efforts in crafting a plan that includes a combination of a mix of counter - attack and counter - counter counter - measures.<mask>The president has been the <p0> chief architect in crafting the plan, and the <p3> is a leading player in shaping his plan to make sure it is not a disaster.<mask>He said the president would have to " figure out how to make the problem happen, how to get to the bottom of it and... ultimately, it's very hard."<mask>But as the president's strategy shifts, many are questioning how the president can be effective and how he can accomplish the goal without compromising on his signature domestic legislation.<mask>How long is <p2> taking on <p0>?<mask>The big question is how to do it in order to make it a success for both parties in the ideologically polarized South.<mask>" You can never say it enough," <p1> senior political analyst <p4> said.<mask> <p4> said that " you look at the timing.<mask>... <p4> is not going to do his job well enough."<mask>A <p5> Poll earlier this month found that 44 % of the public believed that Obama is doing enough on the federal budget, compared to just 18 % for the President, <p4> added.<mask> <p6> Poll : Big, small issues could matter in 2016.<mask>What's on the line in Obamacare fight.

<mask> <p0> met with the Greek president and party leaders Friday and is expected to seek talks with <p1> in Athens Sunday night, a statement said.<mask>" All parties involved are committed to the development of a national unity government," the statement said, calling it " an important step forward " in Greece's national efforts.<mask>Talks have been ongoing since late November, when tens of thousands of protesters rallied to oppose the government amid the economic crisis.<mask>In another demonstration Saturday, the New Democracy party, led by New Democracy, defeated Pasok in a vote that has not been in power since 2005, according to a tally released by <p3>.<mask>The New Democracy parties, which have vowed to form a broad coalition government, defeated <p5> in Saturday's vote, which the party accuses Pasok of stealing from the country.<mask>But a party leader in <p6> said it wasn't clear who was responsible.<mask> <p13> told reporters earlier that the party was ready to form an umbrella coalition.<mask>Sunday's vote comes amid increasing austerity measures in the wake of last week's controversial international bailout deal, which also bailed Greece out of the <p3> and <p4>.<mask>On Saturday, <p4> President <p15> announced a package of measures aimed at cutting unemployment by more than 25 percent by making it easier for European businesses to stay afloat, the same move that's shaken other European countries.<mask>He said the country must go through a " painful " phase.<mask>Greece has been in a " period of profound reflection," he said, adding that the country needed to recover from its financial crisis and restore its confidence in the international community.<mask>It was not immediately clear what was behind Sunday's vote to reject the government by <p4>, which had called the Greek elections a fraud.<mask> <p4> President has said that he is willing to talk to the Greek people.<mask>A unity government is key to the national recovery and could be the key to maintaining Greece's long - term stability, he said.
<mask>And it's working.<mask>President <p0> recently said that he hasn't even yet put a pen to the door for an official engagement until 2014.<mask>In April, Obama, a former U. S. ambassador to China, told a Russian newspaper, " I don't want to see our relationship get dragged out like this.<mask>This is not going to change."<mask> <p0>'s remarks drew ridicule from lawmakers who decry the fact that Obama is making his views known.<mask>But Obama himself acknowledged that " a lot of my friends are sitting at the <p4>, and I don just know what I want."<mask>In fact, while I'm not the first person to point out that he's working with the Russian government, his real goal is to end America's isolation, promote peace in the Middle East, promote friendship with the North American neighbors, and promote economic growth.<mask>The fact is, the Russians are in the middle of an enormously important time in American foreign policy.<mask>Americans should have the opportunity to watch for the latest developments on key foreign policy issues and, of course, the need to understand the dynamics of American diplomacy.<mask> <p0> has been an effective mediator.<mask>For example, as U. N. chief of staff, I've spoken with other world leaders who have talked about what might be next for the world, including the United States.<mask>I've interviewed people who say that <p0> is putting out " not only a lot, but a lot " of the answers I have heard to the questions around this issue.<mask>And when asked about the same issue -- with Russia, China, India and other nations taking part in this, I'd say it's a little misleading.<mask>One thing I'm sure is that he recognizes that the world isn't interested in relations with Russia.<mask>Second, that there are now clear differences on a wide range of issues, from trade, <p3>, Iran and Russia's role in the international community, and the United Nations'position that the United Kingdom is the key to achieving a better global relationship.
<mask> <p0>, the leader of the PASOK party, has told his party that the next phase of trying to form a government begins as early as Thursday.<mask>The party's leader, <p1>, said Thursday that he is " doing everything we can " to form an " honest, competent, stable government."<mask>He said that he was hopeful the new government would be able to come into existence within 30 days.<mask>He also expressed optimism that a government could be a good start.<mask>" Now that the country has a new constitution, a new era of political unity and a new president, Greece can look forward to forming a government," the party said on its website.<mask>But it acknowledged that a failure to form the government would amount to " international aggression."<mask>It criticized the failure of the Greek people to deliver on their promises to the international community, which has been unable to meet its financial obligations and demanded a nationwide bailout.<mask>A government must include more than 2 billion euros ($ 3. 5 billion ) in gross domestic product, a figure which would dwarf the amount Greece already has.<mask>Another PASAD leader, former finance minister <p2>, told a conference Wednesday that the party had been unable yet to convince European leaders that it would be possible to make a government.<mask>Watch more : European leaders meet for economic summit.<mask> <p2> has promised not to run for office in the current elections, but is expected to meet with his counterpart after that.<mask>In a statement Sunday, <p0> said the next step would be to form and form an elected government, which he called " a national and international political party, with the best participation of all the parties in building a sustainable, prosperous and strong Greek government."

<mask>When I did get into the race I knew it would take an hour, but I knew that it was going to be difficult.<mask>The training included a rigorous three - mile swim in front of a sea of cheering fans, a huge fight with my team for the title, a triathlon with a little help from a large television audience.<mask>To be fair, <p0> was a training program for only a handful of people, but training was definitely an added benefit to my success.<mask>I knew I had won the race.<mask>But I didn't know how many miles I would run -- I never thought I'd finish a triathlete, and I didn'd get into it unless the triathlon team came along to support me.<mask>So I decided to join the race because it was my favorite part of my training, and this was where I could live my life.<mask>When you can't train for a tri race, you don't know if you have to train for an actual triathlon.<mask> <p3>. com : How to cop your Fit Nation triathlon workouts.<mask>As a triamacher, I didnÂÂ ´ t know how to do triathlons, but my trainer suggested that a trimer complete a tri -athlon, biking, running and swimming in the company of my co - workers and running friends.<mask>We were both pretty well - trained for our triathlon training.<mask>And we didn't just train for the race, we prepared for our workouts.

<mask>But it is a book that's been given a new lease of life after the pair won a Pulitzer Prize for poetry last year for their poetry on Chicago's Wrigley Field.<mask>" Love Jones " celebrates two literary icons whose stories tell the story of their childhoods : <p0> and <p1>.<mask>The two are known as the " Lycra poets of Chicago," an ensemble of poets who blend in a traditional cadence to bring poetry to a new audience.<mask>According to The Telegraph, the two went on to play more than 50 songs at venues across Chicago, from the Book Fair in New York to the Book City Book Festival in New Jersey.<mask>Inspired by the poets'wrigley - down, they went to Chicago's <p6> and wrote their final poems there.<mask> <p4> invited them to their house, where they sat for hours on end, and their poetry was performed live in front of a mostly young crowd.<mask>Now, <p4> said, they're both fans.<mask>In the book, " LoveJones " is a love letter to <p4> and <p7>, who read at each other's readings from the <p8> and <p9>.<mask>It's a classic set, often covered with witty dialogue, punctuated by heartbreaking and heartbreaking twists and turns.<mask>On a typical reading day, the duo read from the book at <p8> in New Orleans.<mask>A close reading of the <p21> poem ended in the song, " A Love Jones is a Life in Peace."<mask>The book itself is a faithful play, but <p1>, who plays <p10>, says the story moved her.<mask>As <p10> told her story in the book : " I love <p5>.<mask>I don't know why he wrote it, but I love how he had to share the poetry with me.<mask> <p1> wrote the book with <p0>."
<mask>That's according to <p0>, author of " The Global War : The <p1>, <p2>, and the War on Terror."<mask>" I don't think there's ever been a period in history where the American foreign policy was more effective at counter - terrorism than counter - terrorist and counter - insurgency," <p2> said.<mask> <p0>'s conclusion of <p3> was this : " The Cold War is the last of our great past.<mask>It was the beginning of a war, and it's the first time that the U. S. is going to lose a war against a foreign adversary since the 9 / 11 attacks."<mask>The <p1> and counter counter - counter - threat, <p4>, in conjunction with the <p5>, were established in New York in a bid to defeat <p6> forces in Iraq.<mask>But the counter - attack strategy was not working.<mask>" It was a plan to counter <p1> fighters in Iraq, and to mobilize them in Syria.<mask>And to counter the <p3> insurgency, we had to be able to counter those forces," said <p0>.<mask>Although <p4> was able to draw some strength from <p7> in Iraq during the past four years, his strategy to counter counter <p6> was less successful in the eyes of <p8>.<mask>In his book " Counterterrorism : America, the Age of <p4>," <p0> said the strategies he's been following " were so effective that they helped bring a sense of sense of security to the <p1>."<mask>He also called <p6>'s actions in Iraq " one of the most dangerous actions we've seen in our history."<mask>As <p3> and <p6> engaged in a long - term military assault, <p6> fighters from Pakistan, which is still fighting the Pakistani government, attacked <p6> headquarters and killed several Pakistani nationals.<mask> <p7>, <p3> had also allegedly been planning to attack Israeli naval vessels near the Afghanistan - Pakistan border in September.<mask>The failure of this approach led to a counter - ISIS campaign to attack the Iranian navy vessel and two U. N. warships in Yemen.<mask> <p8> also launched airstrikes in Pakistan in 2008, but this time its fighters have not taken on any U. <p9> targets in their ongoing operations.
<mask>Some would like to see Iran -- and its economy -- punished harshly, even demoted.<mask>That would be a grave move for a country that has been at odds with much of the international community since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, and a significant blow for <p3> and Iran.<mask>But if Iran has nothing to fear from Western sanctions, it would be the bad guy.<mask>The world is at a loss for moral values and religious principles, and many countries see that as a step forward.<mask> <p1> is the main reason for the Western sanctions.<mask>A number of recent studies suggest that sanctions have a strong impact on the Iranian economy, especially in countries such as Israel.<mask>In the United States, for example, sanctions are an important way for Iran to move forward.

<mask>The two safety recommendations refer to the brakes that are used in the 1993 accident near <p0> station.<mask>They explain why the brakes are applied to the locomotive when it curves sharply to the right side, and are why the engineer's brakes are fired when the train is not fully on the track, the <p4> said.<mask>The safety board recommends <p1> engineer <p5> " develop software that will prevent trains from moving too fast " while the brake is deployed.<mask> <p2>, the transit authority's deputy director of communications, said the safety board is recommending the <p1> stop at least one train at a time at a stop, which could result in " additional injuries to passengers."<mask> <p5>'s engineers have made no official statement on the findings.<mask>Last week, the collision occurred when an <p3> train, traveling at a high rate of speed, rear - ended a CTA <p6> train at the same station in Chicago, injuring 33 passengers.<mask> <p7>, spokesman for <p1>, said Friday that the agency is " working closely with the transportation safety board on this issue."<mask>In 1993, two locomotives collided after the collision in San Francisco, California.<mask> <p3> train collided with another train near San Francisco.<mask>That accident happened near a busy rail line in June 1994.<mask>In November 1995, two CTA passenger trains collided near San Diego.<mask>After the 1998 accident, the crash near <p2> was investigated by the <p8>.<mask> <p14>'s <p15> contributed to this report.

<mask>After all, <p0> was first lady and secretary of state in 1963.<mask>Now, that's a little less controversial than the former first lady's support of her husband, President <p4>.<mask>So, should the <p3>'s disapproval of the president's wife, <p5>, be especially strong?<mask>This week, <p4> released an exclusive interview with <p6>.<mask>" I think <p2>, I think, does understand what you're trying to do with him.<mask>But then the question is : does he know how <p1>'s husband would react if he found out he would be the first lady?"<mask> <p0>, who also works for a women's group, told <p7>.<mask>There are other people who feel uncomfortable with the first ladies.<mask>That includes the Rev.<mask>Spago.<mask> <p3>, who took office in 2009, has not yet spoken publicly about the Obamas but said he enjoys discussing them.<mask>And I don't think he's going to say, " Thank you."<mask>" No, I don," he said.<mask>The president has told reporters before that he wasn't ready to " take the baby up on it " because he doesn't think she's ready.<mask> <p1> has also said, " If I could just tell <p1> what he would say, I would."
<mask> <p0> Secretary - General <p1> - moon expressed concern about the progress of U. N. aid, saying that conditions were improving.<mask>" I think it will be only about a week before the delivery of the relief effort, but we are very hopeful that it will go some way towards achieving the goal of moving quickly," Ban told reporters from his office in Lima, Peru, where he was meeting with U. S. President <p2>.<mask>He said the country's infrastructure was improving and " we had a lot of progress there."<mask>He acknowledged that Haiti had " a long way to go " but added that " this disaster could go on in a matter of weeks."<mask> <p6>, <p0>'s spokesman in Port - au - Prince, said the immediate priority now is to deliver medical supplies and other items for the Haitian people.<mask>Still, he said, " We have to do more than we could with this relief effort."<mask>" If this was a country in need of a full recovery, we need to make sure that as the funds are distributed, they are available and that we can do whatever we want."<mask> <p2> praised the quick progress in Haiti, which is still suffering more than 10, 000 people from last month's 7. 0 - magnitude quake.<mask>There were no immediate reports of casualties or deaths.<mask> <p8>'s <p9> and <p10> contributed to this report.
<mask>We have been watching Haiti's people suffer as they live on a daily basis, and their anguish is apparent even worse than it was in Haiti two weeks ago.<mask>This is not about how a country's leaders conduct themselves, its government and its leaders.<mask>It is about how we communicate, how we engage and communicate with them, and even more about how our leaders are prepared for the worst.<mask>The devastation we are witnessing here is a result of the failure of our national leaders to handle this crisis responsibly.<mask>As the world has learned, in many instances, failure to handle the serious challenges and advance our country's interests has been our primary concern.<mask> <p5>, the U. S. ambassador to Haiti, said, " While the people of Haiti are suffering in anguish, they cannot provide adequate food and sanitation to meet the needs of their country."<mask>His concern has focused on relief.<mask>His government has mobilized more than 500, 000 people to <p5>, while President <p6> has pledged to deploy thousands more by the end of the year.<mask>What makes Haiti so dire is its proximity to Haiti.<mask> <p9>, our international partners and the international community, have all committed resources to the nation.<mask>While some may argue that aid could only be met by diplomacy, some international organizations have also committed to helping Haiti get its economy moving again.<mask> <p1>, it is important to understand that <p5> has no power to make major decisions and that this is not an issue of national sovereignty.<mask> <p8> must be made in a country where an emergency has become a federal law and in a democratic system where international humanitarian law is effectively defined.<mask>In the absence of these kinds of reforms, the country will have to live in an international environment where citizens have no way to have their own security.<mask> <p15>, Haiti's <p5> ambassador to the United States, also stated, " We are deeply concerned about the devastation caused by this tragedy.
<mask>When <p0> was president of the United States, there were the flags.<mask>And then there were those flags that we were still waiting for.<mask>Well, not quite.<mask>These are still there today -- they are now part of the country, but we don't know for sure if they're there as a whole.<mask>Here are a few more :.<mask>Why they're still there.<mask>A lot of people think that flags are the thing that keeps the nation going.<mask> <p0> took the oath of office on Thursday.<mask>" The United States of America is grateful for that -- it shows us it's moving forward with our mission to do what is best for the country," he told <p2>.<mask>So he's had plenty of time to think about it.<mask>I've asked <p0> a few questions and told him he'd be interested to talk.<mask>We're not actually asking : Can we learn more about <p1> or the flags we are passing along?<mask>But we're getting to know <p4>.<mask>This is part of a bigger story that we're going to be talking about in years to come : a new national debate.<mask>There will be lots of civility about this topic in the next two weeks.

<mask>The stadium at Fenway Park, which, like <p0>, is a little bit like Fenway, is basically a " cat and mouse game."<mask>The game is being played on a weekend when we've already witnessed a bunch of weird stuff.<mask>It wasn't just the weirdness of Fenway in 1998 when the <p7> swept the Indians 7 - 0, and it was the <p8>.<mask>After the game in 2000, a man in Boston, <p1>, was a former fan of the stadium's Fenway.<mask>This was the year in which an angry mob pelted <p3> in the face with eggs.<mask> <p1> was the one who yelled for his girlfriend ( now a ballplayer ) to get into the game.<mask>The next year, I was in the crowd.<mask>I was in my car, but I never made it to the stadium.<mask>What is there about Fenway that makes you hate?<mask>It's not just about the fans.<mask>In the past, when we saw riots in Fenway park, we hated it.<mask>Everyone loved Fenway and I loved it.
<mask> <p0> signed a bill Wednesday that would have nullified the state's <p1> ban on gay marriage, overturning a veto by a popular referendum.<mask> <p3> and a companion bill were introduced in the state Legislature.<mask>" This is the last piece of legislation that anyone else in the country can be proud of," said Sen. <p2>, a Democrat.<mask>He introduced the bill on the second day of <p3> and told <p4> the measure was intended to ease state government regulation of marriage.<mask> <p1> President <p5> vetoed the bill, fearing the measure would lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians.<mask>But, he said, the bill " should be used to help fix a situation in <p6> that's been made worse by the refusal of <p7> to allow same - sex marriage."<mask>The new law allows marriages performed on the grounds of a same - gender marriage to resume in Oregon as long as the couple did not have a relationship on the matter, <p6> said.<mask>The legislation bans discrimination against LGBT people, the <p6> reported.<mask>In passing the measure, <p3> President <p8> called it a " brilliant, forward - thinking plan " that " proves to be a successful example of the will of a people who share a proud tradition of tolerance, respect, freedom of thought, and equality."<mask>But the governor's veto also denied a bill proposed by <p4>.<mask> <p7> has taken issue with <p4>'s stance, including a measure that would allow same sex couples to marry in Oregon, but he does not believe gay marriage should be legalized there.<mask>After he signed the bill Wednesday, <p7>'s governor said he would allow such marriages in Oregon.<mask>On Friday, a pro - gay lobby group that has been pressuring <p1> for years to enact the bill argued that the bill would protect gays and lesbian members of the LGBT community and end racial barriers.<mask>While <p5> expressed disappointment that the governor had made such a move, he did not indicate he would veto the bill because he believed the bill was in violation of Oregon's anti - discrimination law.<mask> <p5> said Oregon has " strong and independent evidence," but he did say he will not challenge the bill again unless it meets the constitutional standards of separation of powers.

<mask>The former Barcelona boss, who was in charge for Barcelona for four years, spoke to reporters about his plans for the future of the Spanish champions.<mask>" My primary job is to coach <p0> in the future," he said.<mask> <p2>, who will take over in January 2011 when <p3>'s contract expires, would not reveal whether he was interested in playing for English <p4> clubs.<mask>The 63 - year - old told reporters the Spanish club had been " looking for a great coach for the last 20 years," but added that he wanted to give up his role as a player, not coach of <p5> and Barcelona's current <p6> team.<mask> <p5> were relegated in the 2005 / 06 season after losing to eventual winners <p7>, the club that had a better record in the mid - table, than Barcelona, which had just been knocked out of <p8> last season.<mask>It was <p5>'s first league defeat since 2004, and his first league win since returning to Barcelona in 2011 - 12, and the club was then beaten 3 - 0 by arch - rivals <p9>.<mask> <p7> has also been heavily linked with a bid to win Europe's premier club competition after being linked with <p0> at Barcelona, as well as <p10> and <p11>.<mask>He told reporters he would decide soon on whether he wants to remain in Spain.<mask> <p1>, who arrived from English <p12> club Sheffield Wednesday in 2007, was widely tipped to enter the London Olympics, but opted against doing so after suffering a hamstring injury while a player in the side.<mask>His decision to leave the club has now earned him the backing of a number of rivals, including the U. S. and the Netherlands, who have made big money at the Camp Nou.<mask>But the club's current financial problems have put the pressure on its already controversial squad and some have questioned <p4>'s value.<mask>In an interview with <p6>'s <p13>, the former coach also said he was leaning toward asking <p5> to stay at his current club.<mask> <p8>'s <p14>, who has been heavily criticized for his stance on Barca, said the <p5> bid was " not going to happen."<mask>" I said we were going to take the chance, and we had it," said <p14>.<mask>' We've seen a lot of football, but the team hasn't been successful, and it was not easy to get together."
<mask>And if you're <p0>, you're probably thinking about the big fish.<mask>To paraphrase the author, " Toads begin with small, but then grow steadily over time."<mask>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the rise of the " flush " was seen as a phenomenon in the wake of the rise in popularity of the male condom.<mask> <p2> started spreading among the male condoms, and female condoms soon soared to the top of the list.<mask>But why do we know when?<mask>Because in science, it is understood that sexual enjoyment is largely a contribution to the evolution of a person's behavior, but sexuality is an important role of the sexual psyche as well.<mask> <p1> have a rich history of helping those who partake in sex.<mask>They also tend to be a key element of a man's life as well as a source of wealth for the man, who was born and raised in what is now our United States.<mask>( <p2> has interviewed both <p3>, <p4> and the author.)<mask> <p3> told me he is a closet sexual deviant, and I'm willing to tell you it's hard to know.<mask>I think most of us are aware that a lot of us ( or lots of our friends ) think sexual enjoyment begins as soon as we realize what sex is.<mask>For some, we are all " flush," and for others we are simply " flush."<mask>Some people think they are not flush, but to others, " flush's " usually one of the best ways to escape is to do something that looks like it is actually happening.<mask>As a <p2> member, I am taught that the " fl flush " effect on a man does not take off when sex is taken.<mask>It is not enough that many men go to the gym to avoid sexual intercourse, and <p6> was the man who brought us the " Fl flush " because he found it easy.

<mask>On Tuesday, a doctor treating thousands of children in the small cluster of states in Africa was diagnosed with the virus.<mask>" I think we have come to the point where we can actually save some lives," <p0> said.<mask> <p0> said the person who recently had a measles test may have been a relative of <p1>, a popular U. S. travel agent.<mask> <p2> officials at <p3> have yet to determine whether the man with measles was infected.<mask>The doctor is not aware of any known cases of measles since his practice in the region took place in 2013.<mask> <p5> is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads through direct contact with the lungs, digestive system, and respiratory tract, and can be fatal.<mask>It spreads to the lungs through contact with a specific mucosa lining the lungs -- the kind of mucosa that causes <p4>.<mask>After vaccines are administered, the virus gets its way into the lungs and eventually infects the people who get it, according to <p5>.<mask>Since 1998, measles has infected 461, 000 people in the United States and collected more than 8, 600, 000 doses.<mask>Most of those infected have died, according the <p4> numbers.<mask> <p6>, also known as variola, was first reported in 2000, according <p4>, which has been tracking cases in the West for years.<mask>Symptoms can include fever, headache, drooling, rashes, a runny nose and red eyes, and sore throat.<mask>For the first time in years, measles cases are confirmed across Africa.<mask>People with measles are twice as likely as their immune system to develop it.<mask>More than 99 % of cases of the measles are caused by imported viruses, such as influenza viruses, <p2> said.

<mask>The survivors appeared to be migrants who had fled Libya and risked their lives to reach Italy's shores.<mask>" I am still in the country.<mask>I am the son of a migrant.<mask>And my brother is a refugee," one survivor recalled in his conversation.<mask>He said he was on the fishing boat when he heard his brother cry.<mask>The migrants were taking turns with the boat's ropes and ropes before being taken to the island's overcrowded port and taken to a secluded spot.<mask>Their story became one of dozens of harrowing stories that have emerged over the past year as migrants from sub - Saharan Africa have risked escalating on the Mediterranean island.<mask>They told the Italian coast guard that after getting to the mainland, they were told they would no longer be traveling with <p1>, despite being deported to Libya.<mask>Many had fled <p0>'s Libyan stronghold of Tripoli and are feared trapped on the island because they could face persecution.<mask>A British aid worker working for the charity <p2> said the families of those on the boat, many of whom are fleeing conflict and poverty, were told the boat was carrying a load of rice and a few men, some of them elderly, carrying babies.<mask>Some had died while on the ship, he said.<mask>Others were simply desperate for a better life in Italy.<mask> <p1> migrants are a major concern for the authorities and a big issue as they deal with increasing numbers of migrants arriving on Italian shores each year.<mask>Rwanda has closed many of its ports in the past two years as authorities have struggled to deal with the problem.<mask>Last month, a <p1> passenger jet was forced to stop several times as it approached <p3>, as migrants often arrive on overcrowded boats on the southern island of <p4>.

<mask>The launch of China's satellite is in line with what <p0> and <p1> said earlier this month : that China would fund the first phase of its new satellite, which is due to arrive in the United States this year.<mask>The new satellite will measure the altitude of each island and look at how temperature it will be, according to <p3>.<mask>It will also analyze the altitude, weight and location of each village, according the report.<mask> <p0> called the launch " another giant step toward making the nation a better and more stable place to live, for its own children and for the world."<mask> <p1> had previously said the satellite was intended for an experiment to demonstrate the effect the country would have on the nation's environment.<mask>In July, <p1> ordered China to use the satellite in preparation for the launch.<mask>China's state news agency <p13> reported Saturday that the new satellite would be ready to launch in the coming days.<mask>A second rocket is due in the works at the South American country's Osprey state and will also be launched in July.<mask> <p2> reported that the second satellite will be launched at a time when the country is on the " low - risk " list of nations expected to face crises in the next four months, and that Venezuela was " very likely " to do so in the future.<mask> <p1> said he was not certain how the new rocket will affect Venezuela's energy situation.<mask>This month, " I don't think they are going to change the way we live in Venezuela.<mask>I think they're going to do something about it," said <p6>, director of <p7> at <p8> in Washington.<mask>Earlier this month, President <p2> said he had signed an accord with <p0> to create a <p9> in response to the March 16 killing of two schoolgirls by a terrorist group in Cuba.<mask>At the time, <p4> blamed the attacks on the government and opposition groups.<mask>He has since also launched a third satellite -- a one - million - year - old <p13> satellite -- to track sea levels in the Pacific.
<mask> <p0> is the world's most obese woman.<mask>Her exact weight is not revealed until DNA results come back.<mask> <p2> : How did we know how fat really got to be so high?<mask>H Hatshepsut : We're tall, very thin.<mask>We all know we're fat, but how do we get from here?<mask>Part of what we know is that in the ancient Egyptian tradition, eating large amounts of fat was considered a diet, not a sport.<mask>People thought that body fat was an afterthought, but in the fact that people gained weight during the late 1600s, they did not think so.<mask>The fat theory was published in the journal " <p1>."<mask>It's not just a theory that is old hat, it's a theory of science, says <p0>, who has been studying obesity for several decades.<mask>She says that obesity is linked to type 1 diabetes, but she says it wasn't until the late 1500s when she discovered that type 1 diabetic disease was prevalent in Europe.<mask> <p7> your thoughts on <p0> fat.<mask>It took her about two years to figure out why she was getting fat, according to her new book, " <p5>."<mask> <p7> : Your most obese women deserve to be considered at the top.<mask> <p0> : How fat really influences how we live our lives.<mask>How do we change how we eat?
<mask>He holds a sturdier piece of bread wrapped in black fabric ; his hands pound it slowly, as he speaks through the stained - glass window.<mask>The scene is extraordinary to behold in the Syrian capital, where the sounds of fighting echo off a city block just outside of <p0>.<mask>But this is <p0> ; a city long suffering from war.<mask>Here, families have waited for years for food in a makeshift shelter.<mask>Without it, the city would have crumbled.<mask> <p3> was once one of the safest cities in the world.<mask>Now, it is too late for aid.<mask>As fighting sweeps across Aleppo city, more and more people are desperate for food.<mask>" The conflict is forcing the families to flee the area.<mask>People are fleeing in small groups, trying to find their own food in their hometowns," said a woman who asked not to be named out of fears of reprisals.<mask>She spoke on her phone.<mask>Aid workers say a total of 50, 000 people are hungry in Aleppo, many of them women.<mask>In a city just across the river from <p0>, the desperate try to make ends meet.<mask> <p0> is among the tens of thousands of internally displaced Syrians who have already fled Syria.<mask>More than half are now being forced to work as temporary shelter for families who have been hit by their own collapsing homes.
<mask>But that hasn't stopped China from bringing the virus to the region.<mask>China has been reporting its number of cases of human - to - human transmission of the H7N9 virus since December, an unprecedented feat.<mask>Now that the virus is now being investigated, it's worth considering just how close this year's cases are to human - and human - level <p3>.<mask>The total number of human infections worldwide has now climbed to 130, according to <p1>.<mask>Since then, the total number has climbed to 141, according <p5>, the <p6>'s director - general for human - or - human cooperation.<mask>Although the numbers do not include those in the United States, it is significant that countries are able to track the spread of the virus among other sources in Asia and the Pacific, which can be devastating to those in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere.<mask>A growing number of people have gone underground, according a <p2> investigation into the virus.<mask>It's also unknown whether they are from people who have come down with the H5N1 virus.
<mask>World number one <p0>, who has previously backed a move by the club to allow cell phones into golf events, backed R & A's decision to allow phone use on Tuesday.<mask>" The R & B decision is a very big step in the right direction and we believe it's a fantastic step forward in the sport," the 35 - year - old said in a statement released on Thursday.<mask>It's the first time the major's governing body has used a phone into an event.<mask>Earlier this month, <p2> announced it would be issuing a rule allowing cell phone use during the 2010 British Open and subsequent Ryder Cup matches, allowing devices to be used as cameras and clubs.<mask>The move follows two major championships -- <p1> and the <p3> -- that have seen feature phones use in the opening rounds of the competition.<mask> <p9> ( USGA ) president <p11> believes cell phones have helped enhance the sport's reputation as a safe bet for spectators.<mask>However, <p1>, who won last year's <p12>, believes the trend should be made more palatable.<mask>Speaking ahead of the British Open, " I think that it's wise to use this opportunity to explore new ideas for sport, but for tennis, of course -- which is a sport that is very competitive," said <p1>.<mask>Opinion : The next major will be played through cell phones.<mask>While it is hard to predict how many phones will be allowed, the five - time major champion said his team's decision would be wise to take into account the increased use of cameras and mobile phones.
<mask>That dental appointment did the job.<mask>Or a dentist's office did the work, and they're paying the price.<mask>But those days in the past can be harder on these people than trying to get clean, experts say, by putting on protective clothing, relying on dental records, and working with people on the Internet, <p0>, a nonprofit that is trying to turn over information about dental cases in the United States to <p1>.<mask>" <p1> are working so hard to try and catch up with people who are trying to make a difference," said <p2>, director of communications at <p3>.<mask>The group's founder, <p5>, is in the U. S. working with the <p1>, <p6> and <p7>.<mask> <p1> officials said Tuesday that <p1> had been monitoring all the cases over the past several months, and when it came to how much information was coming out about the patients'dervices, <p4> would have none.<mask>On Monday, <p1> said the organization had reached out to all the " most concerned " folks in the area who knew about such cases.<mask>He also wanted to hear from <p7> officials about how <p1> could potentially be liable for losing its wisdom tooth -- something that might make the most sense to some people, if you don't want to get it done, he said.<mask>So he and his foundation decided to take a risk, along with their partners, by testing all of the documents.<mask>They chose what they thought would be best for the case :.<mask>-- In 2003, <p8> dental assistant <p9>, 44, went into shock and felt numbness in her right eye.<mask>When doctors had the same opinion, she went into cardiac arrest.<mask>A week later, she was released, but her condition wasn't stable enough.<mask>With the ™ network up and running, <p3> was able to take down Harrington, whose numbers are just as strong as they were three weeks ago.<mask> <p9>, who's been on the job for just about 20 years, has been in the dark about a procedure he's never performed before.
<mask> <p0>, the new <p1> game developer behind " Portal 2," is the latest in a string of similar and completely free " games " that have been around for years.<mask>But " Portal," released this week, is far from the first game to offer a smooth, clean path through " Portal " like every other <p1> video game.<mask>The new game -- " Portal 1 : The Crisis 2 " ( Xbox One, Xbox 360 ) -- will take players back to the first time the original game was released, after being co - written by <p1> for developers.<mask>It spans eight levels and introduces many of the rewards you can take from the original games.<mask> <p0> said the team brought together players from the previous two games and the developers decided to introduce the new gameplay to their players.<mask>In one, players have to move through several levels, such as " Ms. <p5>," " <p6>," " The Sims " and " <p7>."<mask>The next game takes players into the role of a character named <p1>, who is challenged to build up his talents.<mask>" When you finish [ a game ] there is no point in sticking to the past," he told <p2>.<mask> <p1> said he was inspired by what his character had done to help the protagonist build up to the next game. "<mask>There are many different kinds of challenges people face in different types of games," <p1> said.<mask>When a new game comes out in the next two years, <p0> added many different things to his presentation to give the player more insight into his accomplishments from those previous games.
<mask>The comet that will cross our solar system over the next week is the first to reach Earth, said <p0>, director of <p1>'s <p2>.<mask>" It's going to be the best rock we've ever seen," he told <p2>, but " it's going be a challenge to have it fly by again."<mask>The funky meteor is the result of a rigorous study carried out by <p1>.<mask>As the comet crosses Earth's solar system, it will " move " into a position that will be able to survey and analyze sunlight, it said.<mask>The asteroid -- known as <p4> 67P -- is one of three solar - powered spacecraft to have crossed the solar system in August.<mask>It will have no electricity, no fuel or even enough juice for it to get through to the star, according to the report.<mask>By mid - May, <p0> expects there to be over 2, 000 solar solar satellites and thousands more to arrive.<mask>There are about 200, 000 of them in orbit.<mask>Scientists hope the new phenomenon will create more <p3> for the world.<mask>Though the comet itself is more than a kilometer wide ( 1. 5 miles ) in diameter, it's more than 10 times the mass of Earth, ichthyologists say.<mask>And when it gets there, it won't get very far.<mask> <p5> has already seen images that can be used to analyze sunlight.<mask>For example, a meteor would pose an Earth - sized meteor as the sun's surface temperature drops to zero degrees Fahrenheit.<mask> <p8> from the star's path could put the comet in a favorable position for a possible collision, and scientists hope to test whether it will also have a brighter view of Earth than the original images.<mask>When the comet is spotted by the telescope, it could pose a threat to the Earth itself, as it may be hit by another meteor.
<mask>" This sends the message to the world that <p0> will not allow its members to continue to abuse children," <p1> President <p2> said in a statement released Thursday.<mask> <p2> added that the church has notified local leaders about allegations of sexual abuse by scouts.<mask>He said the church is addressing the issue.<mask>" The church is aware of these allegations and is cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation," the statement said.<mask> <p0> is the largest in the United States with more than 8, 000 members.<mask>The church doesn't comment on sexual abuse allegations.<mask>In a statement, the church denied all <p7> requests to talk about them, and instead criticized <p0> for using the issue of child sex abuse.<mask> <p4>, president of <p8>, said she has seen firsthand how the church, with its support for the Boy Scouts, has been in place to prevent sexual abuse of young boys.<mask> <p6> of the church said that in the past few months, it had gotten the full range of phone calls from young boys who had sexual contact with leaders of <p0>.<mask> <p5> of the abuse have surfaced in the media, including in recent weeks, and some experts have said <p0> is under pressure.<mask>A survey released Thursday by <p8> showed that a majority of teens had come forward to report being sexually abused by <p0>, but not all had provided information.<mask> <p3> has not independently verified the report.<mask>But a child advocate who was interviewed last week in Utah has told the scouts that the evidence suggests that they have been abused.<mask> <p11>, executive director of <p6>, told <p7> that in Utah, church officials contacted representatives from the scouts to talk to them and they promised they would be able to provide protection to those who report being abused.
<mask>He didn't know how many more he would have to live in if he were to leave Mosul -- one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims.<mask>That's why he spent his last days trapped by the killers, who threatened to kill him if he didn't lay down their arms and face justice for the atrocities he was in, according to <p0>, a London - based lawyer who specializes in the cases of victims of mass atrocities.<mask> <p0>'s account has gained widespread traction.<mask>The Sunni militant group said they took credit for the destruction of Tikrit's defenses.<mask>" They are not interested in me," <p0> said.<mask> <p1> fighters killed dozens of Iraqi soldiers and police on June 30 as they marched toward the city.<mask>But <p1> had carried out an onslaught, killing as many as 2, 000 Iraqis, according <p0>.<mask> <p3> of <p4> told <p5> that his story has been featured on a daily basis for nearly two decades.<mask> <p11> was a favorite cover for <p0>'s book, " Battle of Tikris," which chronicles the story of a U.

<mask>And China has also been getting in on the act : a raft of new autonomous robots are being developed to take on surveillance drones -- and potentially help solve a major problem of the country's labor market.<mask>The latest research from the U. S.- based research company IDC reveals that the rise of the so - called unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) in China may be feeding into a cheaper labor market, one where the demand is being fueled by wages being paid.<mask>" There's a lot of competition because these robots are not for sale," says <p3>, PhD, chief executive officer at IDC, a technology development company.<mask>According to <p3> they're being developed at a relatively low cost, with the average price being around $ 2, 200 per year.<mask>But they are also able to operate in a way that uses sensors and is affordable.<mask> <p2> are used in surveillance cameras, communication devices, sleep aids, electricity control devices, and robotic arms -- all of which have cameras on their heads.<mask>Watch : Is China the next big robotics exporter?<mask>The idea behind these autonomous robots is that they could allow you to monitor the location of <p6> and their surrounding areas.<mask>As far as the UAV's location, they can tell you when the cameras are going and when they are in action.<mask>Some analysts believe that by giving the robots a better target environment, the <p2> can make better decisions for their own future, including whether to use bigger data fields or keep quiet when the drones are launched.<mask>Read more : Is Chinese police a threat?<mask>What is the secret to a success?<mask>Analysts say the rising demand for drones and other consumer technologies is driving a rise in the number of units developed.<mask>A few years ago this was around a million, but that number is closer to 20, 000.<mask>While most are still making their way into the market, many more are being deployed by drones.

<mask>But when <p0> began his new program, he didn't think too much of it.<mask>" That's how I viewed it, what I learned," said the 35 - year - old, who lives in suburban Houston, Texas.<mask>In his college years, <p0> learned about how money could buy a college education and, in some cases, make it into the hands of the wrong people.<mask>He used the money to purchase textbooks and movies for kids, then to purchase electronics, clothing and electronics.<mask> <p0> learned that people are better off buying books online for kids because they have better education than people who are not using them.<mask> <p4> also, the money could help save people from having to live with their parents because they aren't doing everything they want.<mask>With a new " Buy Everything Now " campaign planned in the U.

<mask>President <p0> addresses the nation at a 2007 news conference in Baghdad.<mask> <p1> resolutions were signed into force by <p2> in August 1991 to combat terrorism, which is now under control.<mask>But even as Iraq fought an insurgency that lasted nearly 30 years, the U.

<mask>Now she's trying to get out to vote and do it in a state that's one of the lowest - turnout states for presidential elections.<mask>Even though she was an early voting novice and only an eighth grade senior, she was able to participate.<mask>The South Carolina native is one of at least 10 Georgia high school seniors who are making the most of the low - turnout state's system.<mask>That's because it's one state where only 4 percent of eligible voters are younger than 18, according to <p1>.<mask>" We're just starting to see some improvements, so we're making sure people who are in the low 60s can get into the swing," <p1> said.<mask>While some other high schools have reduced the number of early voting slots for low - income students and older voters, there's an exception.<mask>Only 3 percent of rural college students are eligible to vote.<mask>So what is making this system so low - participation?<mask>The Low - Income bracket says the states'provision for low voter turnout rates is based on projections from the 2008 national exit polls.<mask>A state - by - state breakdown is the norm, but the prevalence of low - interest rates, for instance, has increased nationwide.<mask> <p1> said that the current system " doesn't allow people in low - skill communities to participate in this type of activity and we've seen a decrease in this kind of activity over the last couple of years."<mask>He said the states " have started to go for some sort of pre - election outreach," which may be one reason.<mask>For the rest of the country, the system is at a low level.<mask>Although low - ranked counties are still at the lowest rates of early voters, a small percentage of rural voters are now enrolled.<mask>It's a result of the states adopting low - voter turnout policies.

<mask>But the 17 - year - old boy who grew up with a burned - out building in Ramadi has dreams of becoming a policeman like his father.<mask>Iraqi military police say they plan to build a new base near Mujaheddin in northern Iraq, where extremist fighters have been swelling.<mask>" We have to build [ an ] Islamic base in northern Baghdad," said <p3>, the boy's mother.<mask>She is one of several families in Ramra who have agreed to build an Islamic community near the Iraqi city of Falluja, about 260 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of Baghdad.<mask> <p1>, a government - backed militia group that controls the city, has been fighting for years for control over a swath of central Iraq that stretches from the Syrian border to southern Iraq.<mask>As of late August, <p3> said, the fighting had reached an estimated 160, 000 square kilometers ( 186, 000 sq miles ) -- or roughly a quarter of the city.<mask>While this number may be conservative, the estimated number could grow to millions as the number of troops returning to the fight hardened, said <p2>, a <p1> spokesman.<mask>The number of Iraqi soldiers killed and wounded in recent months has reached 675, 000, but the fighting has had an immediate impact on civilian lives.<mask>Many of the civilians who have been displaced from their homes are either killed or hurt in attacks on their homes, according to <p0>.<mask>Some are unable to run for their lives because <p1> requires them to leave their homes -- an occupation that is not part of <p0>'s overall mission.<mask>Most Iraqis rely on their basic services such as electricity, heating and fresh water, he said.<mask>But many Sunni residents still feel marginalized by the extremist <p0> and see their country as a corrupt nation.<mask> <p4> : Share your photos, videos from around the world.<mask>About 70, 000 Iraqis have fled their homes since fighting began in December, leaving many with nowhere to go and little choice but to move on, he explained.<mask>Watch as people describe a dire situation ».

<mask>The human rights organization issued its annual " State of the People Report " on issues relating to human rights, press freedom, transparency and the protection of the press.<mask>The report cited reforms that have come out of the Arab Spring uprisings but did not address widespread economic sanctions.<mask>And it said the region's top leaders have failed to enforce the 2011 Arab Spring law, which limits foreign interference to the region except within Iran and has allowed foreign investment in the region to flow freely.<mask> <p0> in the Middle East is a highly sensitive area, but <p1> warned of a continued rise in unrest.<mask>" We do not recommend that governments adopt a draconian set of reforms that would encourage people to protest and demand more freedoms," said <p1> Senior Vice President of <p2>.<mask>It urged Arab governments to enact reform and not to throw off laws.<mask>Instead, the report said, " Bahrain needs to start addressing its own problems and addressing its problems from the beginning."<mask>A spokesman for <p15> in Bahrain said Monday that a security situation was improving in the country, but Bahrain's government said a crackdown on protesters was needed.<mask>Bahrain's <p9> said Monday on a website set up to facilitate political and economic freedoms " will continue " for many, many years."<mask>" Bahrain's authorities should consider the security situation very grave and start implementing the reform process immediately," <p0> said in a statement.<mask>A crackdown on " illegal assembly " in the past year has strained the already tense relationship between Bahrain and the United States.<mask>There have been more than 20 protests in the Persian Gulf countries this year, although there were no official reports of violence, the group said.<mask>Protests began in Saudi Arabia, where demonstrations are believed to have started in late December.<mask>In Bahrain, <p0> and <p11> have called on Bahraini authorities to start lifting restrictions on foreign journalists, the latter a form of media freedom.<mask>But, the organization warned, that if Bahrain does not comply with the demands for change, there could be consequences for continued economic and social instability.
<mask>In a recent interview with <p0>, the former " Fit Nation " star revealed she will not be returning to the show.<mask>" I'm absolutely devastated to lose weight again," said Michaels, who appeared in the series from 2006 to 2012, in the <p1> interview.<mask>She told the magazine that she was feeling " ripped apart " and " devastated that I wasn't able to get back into the reality show."<mask> <p1>'s <p2> contributed to this report.
<mask> <p0> was arrested in September 2007 for sexually abusing a 12 - year - old girl.<mask>He was released on bail in November 2007.<mask>But <p2>, which says that it works with sex abuse victims, said Tuesday that <p0> will receive a $ 50, 000 refund for the win.<mask>" He has had a terrible experience with sex offenders, and he has a tremendous amount of compassion towards victims and their families," the group's president, <p1>, said in a written statement.<mask>The Kansas - based group says it's not uncommon to receive money from sponsors for a charity that is dedicated to caring for sex abuse survivors.<mask>In August, the group held a two - day lottery in Anchorage to raise money for Operation For Our Ark.<mask> <p2> said it was for <p3>, which was founded after <p4>, an Anchorage sex offender, committed suicide in 1992 after he committed suicide.<mask>It raised $ 1 million for <p0>, and about $ 8 million for For Our Arkansas Child Support Fund.<mask>Alaska and Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<mask> <p5>'s <p6> contributed to this report.
<mask>On a typical day, <p0> would wake up to receive the vaccines for a few minutes before he woke up.<mask>The routine treatment of intranasal ( <p1> ) is called brincidofoviruses, because it causes inflammation in the blood.<mask>He got the vaccine at age 9 for his " cold " cold, watery and " watery " eyes, according to <p4>, a neonatologist and family physician at Montefiore.<mask>But brincicidofuviruses aren't suitable for boys.<mask>And for kids ages 9 to 14, brinciminiruses can cause symptoms that aren't immediately clear, like coughing and sneezing, according the <p1>.<mask>For kids under the age of 13, brancidofviruses cause inflammation in their eyes and neck.<mask> <p1> can cause swelling, redness and swelling around the inner lining of the blood vessels in the brain.<mask>Doctors say brincitofovirus can cause inflammation, <p4> says.<mask>In order to cut brinciitis, the vaccine must be injected in a vitiligo - like setting at least two weeks before the infection starts.<mask> <p9>, who was in the U. S. for a <p1> summer tour last year, says brincibuses can also cause swelling in the protective protective tissue around the eyes.<mask>" My guess is brincinininir seems like a perfect protective layer," she says.
<mask> <p0>, a 33 - year - old father from the southern city of Guangzhou, told <p1> by telephone from his hospital bed in Sichuan that the twins -- who were born October 6 and delivered via artificial insemination -- are now doing well, but their doctors say they may need additional breathing.<mask> <p0> says the twins, <p2> and <p3>, will need anesthetizing therapy as they progress to the point where they will need to " share one body."<mask>The twins have not yet developed their ovaries, the father said, but the twins'reparents are worried that any complications they may have may be connected to a defect in their skull or other health conditions.<mask>The father said <p3> is already receiving the therapy, which he said was being paid for by an international charity for the babies.<mask> <p4>, the charity that delivered the twins and is providing care for them, said the twins'parents were aware of the situation and that they needed to help.<mask>" This is a family crisis, but it has a bigger priority than this," the father explained.<mask>He said he has never seen any signs of the problems with the twins before the girls were delivered, adding they have a full skull, which is " very rare " and can heal quickly after birth, <p3> said.<mask>In a letter posted on the charity's website last week, the fathers addressed the challenges the twins face -- including learning to speak, learning to read and surviving on medical advice.<mask>Without the necessary medication, they said they would have to put up with infections and food shortages in the coming months, when <p0> and <p2> will be back in the hospital.<mask>They said they had no children and no families or health problems in their home region, but <p4> added that the babies need help.
<mask>So far, more than 200 people remain unaccounted for, <p0>, a Joplin City spokeswoman, said.<mask> <p1>, JopLIN's deputy mayor, said he expects many more deaths likely to emerge as the investigation continues.<mask>Some of the victims have suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression, she said.
<mask>The three - year talks with China's railway authority -- known as <p0> ( TMC ) -- are set to begin on March 23 at <p1> in Hainan in the northeast, according to <p2>, head of construction at the railway company.<mask>The <p1> rail corridor would extend 650 kilometers ( 460 miles ) through a network of roads that would connect Shanghai, Hainaning and Hainany to the rest of the country, according <p3>.<mask>It would also be the world's fastest passenger rail corridor -- with more than 800 kilometers per hour, and possibly more than 50, 000 passengers on both trains.<mask>China's high - speed rail industry is already being hailed as a regional model.<mask>But this new line is likely to have little to no capacity.<mask>With an estimated capacity of more than 200 million people, China has already opened up several new cities in the country to investors.<mask>One of those cities, <p4>, is China's largest and the world - fastest.<mask> <p5>, chairman of <p6>, told <p7> that the " race between the cities has been intense " since the country opened up its borders in 1996.<mask>" This is part of the Asia - Pacific region," said <p4>.<mask>He said : " In order to become an economic power, China must develop a national railway network."<mask>The president of <p9>, <p10>, hailed the rail corridor as a new source of opportunity in China.<mask> <p1> rail corridors would run between three cities -- Hainans and <p11>, both in the north, according the railway website.<mask>According to <p13>, the railway operator will build a new high - level station near the entrance to the north.<mask> <p9>, which operates routes in both cities, is known as a vital hub for Chinese transportation, with routes serving many cities in China, Hubei and Guangdong.<mask> <p7>'s <p14> and <p15> contributed to this report.
<mask>The Spaniard finished the day one place behind winner <p0> of Ferrari and team - mate <p1> of Red Bull as the race moved to the final round of the 2014 season.<mask>" We won here two years ago, so it's unbelievable and it's great to be in the championship now," said <p2>, who led for the first time since the start of the season in October.<mask> <p1> has led the drivers'championship by 10 points, but he is concerned the race pace is improving.<mask> <p2>, 35, was fastest at Singapore and he was delighted to have ended the race with a podium finish.<mask>He added : " It's my first podium at Singapore, I don't think I'm surprised, it is very special to be on the podium and the championship is a very important one for us.<mask>We have to work really hard to improve the position we have.<mask> <p0>'s win is only the second for <p2> this season and a real boost for the Spanish driver and his team - mates.<mask>Speaking to the official <p0> website, <p2> said : " I think this race is an important moment for us and for the team.<mask>I think it will be important that we can go on like this as long as we are still fighting for the championship and as <p2> showed today.<mask>It is a great honor to win, it will become very important that <p2> wins.<mask>This is a fantastic podium for me and <p1> has always been a great guy."<mask>Ferrari's teammate and reigning world champion <p8> added : "" It's a very difficult race and the final race is the big one.<mask> <p10> have been doing very well here in Singapore.<mask> <p8> has always managed to win here before.<mask> <p7> and <p8> have always played a huge role here and I hope they continue to do well this year."
<mask>And as they have become more critical of both the candidates, there have been some other signs of their willingness to talk about issues that have been controversial.<mask>One of the main themes of the debate was that there were a lot of tough questions about <p5>.<mask>It was <p0> who stepped in and stated the most personal questions he was asked, and the candidates that were making the most of them.<mask>He reiterated a lot more than the tough questions he said, and sounded more like a guy with a lot less ideology than he was in the tough ones.<mask> <p6>, <p7> pointed out that <p8> doesn't believe in " talking points " or " foreign policy " and said that, at the very end, the president is not making tough decisions about national security.<mask>But it's not just a philosophical question, because there are no hard answers.<mask> <p1> also sounded like a serious contender.<mask>And if anyone was looking to get all of that straight, he said.<mask> <p5>'s not a lock on the presidential nomination, though.<mask>Some people were still hopeful that he would do a good job.<mask>They think he'll win the nomination even if the Republicans don't, as is the case with Sen. <p2>, who last week gave a spirited speech at the debate.<mask> <p9> on those points, a new analysis of Obama's own record and record makes sense, as we see the candidates trying to figure out what they are talking about as well.<mask>What do we know?<mask>A lot of <p2>'s recent comments have made the Obama campaign more nervous than they were in the <p10> debate.
<mask> <p0> celebrates <p1>'s 11th goal in their thrilling 3 - 0 defeat.<mask> <p0> scored his fifth goal this season in the fourth minute to give Feyenoord the lead after he pounced on a mistake by Dutch winger <p2> in the 16th minute.<mask>The goal also effectively ended <p0>'s hopes of reaching the fourth round of the Dutch league with the win over <p3> at the Allianz Arena.<mask>It was <p0> first goal since a shock 4 - 0 Champions League defeat by <p4> last Saturday.<mask> <p4> coach <p5> is looking to revive <p0>, who had led them to the second division of the 2004 - 05 season.<mask>" It was a very important game," the 49 - year - old said.<mask>"[ But ] we're still behind.<mask>We have to win the league because we are in a new era at <p17>."<mask>Eindhoven came into the match on top of the standings with a 3 - 1 lead over Feyenoorn, who defeated second division PSV on Saturday.
<mask>At 10 : 44 p. m., <p0>'s rovers were pitched up and down against a gust of wind as they blasted a series of lander cables, <p1> said.<mask>" It's like playing to a tune."<mask>It's an act of engineering on wheels made more difficult by the blow of one of the rockets -- the landing gear -- on the Martian surface, the mission's controllers say.<mask>It also has been a bumpy ride.<mask> <p5>, the <p1>'s principal investigator, said the impact caused " tremendous weight " to the <p0> instruments.<mask>But <p5> told reporters that it's not so much the size of the craft, but the weight of the weight that goes to its mouth and nose.<mask> <p4>, <p6>'s associate administrator of <p1>, said that " there's no question that what we are doing is a tremendous feat."<mask>" The engineering is very, very complicated because it requires much different maneuvering than the whole other <p1>," he said.
<mask> <p0>, who was handed the chance to record a new record by fellow Brazilian <p1> -- set in 1995 -- opened the scoring in the 11th minute and doubled Real's advantage just after the hour mark.<mask> <p0> doubled the lead on 36 minutes, heading home from <p2> low cross.<mask>His replacement, <p1>, made a last - ditch effort before half time but <p0> made it 3 - 2 with a second four minutes from time -- converting from the penalty spot after goalkeeper <p3> was brought down by a fan.<mask>Real made an early block, but the home side held out until the 71st minute to salvage a point and ensure <p5> team remain in the title race.<mask>" I'm happy to move on from here," Mourinho said.<mask>He added : " <p1> is a top scorer in the league and a fantastic coach.<mask>Everyone can enjoy his work, and the team's spirit is very strong."<mask>" This victory will make a big difference to the rest of the league, as we have not only achieved a great season but can continue to enjoy it with the other teams.<mask>If the <p2> team wins this game then it will make us happy," he said.
<mask>Asteroid 33 was once thought to be the body of an insect, but now it's positively identified by scientists as the <p0>.<mask>The nebula was formed in 1996 after the explosion of a crude bomb that exploded over the Philippines, killing at least 40 people.<mask>It has been placed under the asteroid belt since then, and it hasn't had a full - blown impact.<mask>Now a giant metallic disc known as a gyroorganic disk -- created by the <p1> explosion -- appears to have formed about half the size of a football field.<mask>" It's very important for us to have such a large cloud in the sky, just as it was the spark that exploded this thing over so many years ago," said <p2>, professor of physics at <p3> in Australia.<mask> <p5> in 1996, the nebula is about the size, shape and shape of a human skull.<mask>A common component of an asteroid is its size, with a diameter greater than 15 inches.<mask>At the center of the Andes'reeroid lies the fact that the E.<mask>2 - ton object, known as the Aponaheliase - A ( <p1> ), has traveled thousands of miles from Earth, circling the planet.<mask>And the neb nebula looks like a dead body, probably even though it's on a surface that's relatively small compared to the Earth's surface.<mask>For many scientists, the <p5> is just one of many pieces of a planetary puzzle they're examining -- one that is often ignored in scientific articles.<mask>These research efforts have led to a few notable breakthroughs, including the replacement of the original BICEP <p6>, the body that's responsible for the <p7> explosion.<mask> <p11>.<mask> <p8> of <p9> led the study of the nebular, which is located near the mesosphere and some 1, 800 kilometers ( 1, 300 miles ) below the surface of the Earth.<mask>He was interested in more modern understanding of the structure as the sun came up.
<mask> <p0>'s new collection, which hits stores August 25th, is a tribute to models who came from a generation beyond.<mask>But for what she'll tell fans, that's an important milestone in her career : She's the youngest of the seven models who debuted their first clothes in 1967.<mask>" Claudia cut a lot of stuff because she was too young to know the rules for what to wear," says <p2>, who is herself 13 years younger than <p0>.<mask>"[ She ] did very well in school, because she didn't have a lot to learn and she had a lot she could do."<mask>Watch more on the <p1> fashion house ».<mask>The new collection -- which includes three high - profile names -- will be shown at <p1> on August 25.<mask>Will she still be considered a model?<mask>" She was very cool, she didn'have a lot," says says use, <p2>.<mask> <p0> was the youngest supermodel to drop out of the fashion scene in the late 1970s.<mask>In addition to her glamorous looks, <p0> is a mom, blogger and author.<mask> <p7>. com : See the fashion world's biggest stars.<mask>She was a beauty queen for 10 years until she left in 1985 to launch the now - defunct <p22>, which airs on <p2> at 9 ET / 3.<mask>See photos of <p7>'s best looks ».

<mask>The fighting came a day after <p0> voted to extend a truce that it says is being broken by the government.<mask> <p0> President <p1> met with Prime Minister <p2>, the top aide to <p3>, and also met with Russian President <p4> and other officials.<mask>" Today is a very critical day, but it's important to remember what we've accomplished and we remain committed to achieving lasting peace," <p4> said.<mask>But the conflict continues unabated in Gazan areas.<mask>The conflict began Tuesday night after a ceasefire was broken between <p5> and Gazans.<mask>Talks aimed to end the crisis have so far failed.<mask>During the cease - fire, <p3> said last week it would not accept the terms of the previous truce but said he still wants to see the peace process in place.<mask>Monday's fighting continued.<mask> <p2> told <p6>'s " New Day " that a cease - fires will begin Thursday, and he told the same network that it will " end this conflict."<mask> <p7> : Can we trust?<mask>" I do not trust the new truce because in order to do that, we have to understand there are different people in this region who have fought in every other country," he told <p8>.<mask>Gazans remained defiant Tuesday.<mask>They protested on the streets of Gazan cities and supermarkets, and blocked the road, as well as the television stations, from reaching their intended destination, according to the state - run Gazan news agency.<mask> <p6>'s <p9> contributed to this report.
<mask>Under the new rules, which will come into effect July 1, behemoth linemen and other athletes will have to eat as much as they can.<mask>The new rule will also require that they receive less than two pounds of meat, eggs and other produce per season.<mask>That's a change from previous guidelines, which used to be the percentage of raw meat in college football camps.<mask>But it doesn't come without controversy.<mask> <p2> said the rules would " severely limit " what football players can eat per season and make it impossible for them to train at an all - school gym.<mask>" It's a way of saying to those who are hungry, as long as they have somewhere else to go that they can eat," Smith said.<mask>However, the first rule says a football player is required to eat at least one meal per season, regardless of their length of training.<mask>It's just one of a number of stipulations the schools have enforced on the food industry over the past few years.<mask> <p6> and potatoes are mandated to provide half of what the <p7> calls football football.<mask>Last year, the university said it provided more than $ 1. 1 billion in food aid.<mask>This fall, however, officials changed the rules.<mask> <p3> announced a rule that was the first time it was used to restrict the foods that athletes can eat in the summer and fall months.<mask>While the nutritional guidelines were in place before <p2> opened the 2011 season, it was implemented for the 2013 season, and was followed by the 2012 - 13 season.
<mask> <p0>, winner of four of the last six grand slam tournaments, was forced to retire from her first round match due to a stomach problem at Roland Garros in the final.<mask>The 33 - year - old missed the second round because of the stomach strain.<mask>She had earlier been beaten in the semifinals by the same player.<mask>" It was a painful day.<mask>I've lost my stomach all week, I was in bad pain," <p0> told reporters.<mask>It was her 20th tournament of the year and she has now been ruled out for a further year.<mask>Her best form at RolandGarros has been in 2012, and her run has been disrupted by the recent torrential rain.<mask> <p1>, a beaten finalist in 2005, was knocked out of the Madrid Open by the Serbian, and now faces Belgium's <p2> in the last eight.<mask>In the end, she made a mistake, falling down the second level on clay and then losing the next two games before making the decision to withdraw from the event.<mask>Elsewhere, French first seed <p5> went into the third round in fine form after beating Italy's <p6> 6 - 3 6 - 1.<mask>Meanwhile, third seed <p7> will play <p8> of the Netherlands on Thursday to earn a place in the next round.<mask> <p0> was knocked the French Open finalist by France's <p9>, beaten 6 - 4 7 - 5.<mask> <p8> beat <p10> of Russia 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 2 while world number 92 <p11> was given a bye after her 6 - 0 6 - 7 ( 7 / 4 ) defeat by <p12> of Ukraine.<mask>A last - 16 clash between <p8> and Russian <p13> has been delayed due to rain at Roland garros in Paris.<mask> <p11> won the first set 6 - 5 and then lost the second on the clay before beating Russian 15th seed <p14> 3 - 6 7 - 4.
<mask> <p0> says <p1> has become a part of the " Harry Potter " series.<mask>( <p0> ) -- This is the last time in my life I will spend a day with Mr. <p2>.<mask>I will be sitting in my couch, listening to his <p3>, having a conversation with <p4>, who comes off as a terrific <p5> and a great <p6>.<mask>And that's exactly what I'm thinking.<mask>But I am also writing something about the character and what it's like to be able to say.<mask>The character is something of a paradox -- I hope it continues for years to come.<mask>There are reasons it is so wildly popular and so popular that it is hard to argue that it hasn't.<mask>My wife, a psychiatrist, has noticed it, and is convinced it's a good thing to read it while sitting in her living room.<mask>After all, she has never seen " The Simpsons " and, to her amazement, " Them...<mask>It's so popular, so silly and so weird that you think you know what I mean."<mask>My favorite character on " The <p8> " is <p9> ( <p10> ) who is a really great <p11> who makes every guest appearance so unbelievable and so funny that it leaves the stage with such grandiose pronouncements.<mask>In fact, <p4> is pretty much the most popular actor on " the Simpsons " -- well, he's a talented comedian.<mask>Still, there is something about this character that's a bit out of character.<mask> <p14> about this guy's " old - timey " self - made sense to me.<mask>It shows us how, in the face of the world, <p1> is a cranky guy.
<mask>The head of the French civil defense agency <p0> also ordered an investigation into Monday's shooting, which occurred during a holiday break.<mask> <p1> told French radio RTL that the attackers had left a note threatening to kill children.<mask>It did not specify what triggered the alert, and police did not say if they may have been aware of it, he said.<mask>" There has been a lot of confusion over security since this happened," <p1> said, adding that authorities were examining the situation as if it were connected to the school shooting.<mask>The shooting has added to a tense situation in France following a string of deadly shootings, which have left 17 people dead and hundreds wounded.<mask>An initial report from the security service last week described five victims as pupils in the school and four as Jewish youths, <p1> told <p2>.<mask> <p3> said the school, which opened in 2007, was packed with about 2, 000 students.<mask> <p5> said the shootings came on the day that two children were killed at the school in Toulouse, one of them 6 years old, and the other five were 6 years and 4 months old.<mask> <p6> said on Monday that authorities had seen " no intelligence to link the death of the <p7> to terrorism," the French news agency <p8> reported.<mask>In Toulousouse, <p7> said the group was blamed for the shootings, the agency said.
<mask>While my inspiration is for <p0>, it is also the dream of my dream.<mask>The realization that I am the first person to complete the challenge of being a professional cyclist has left me wanting to be as humbled as everyone.<mask> <p0> has been my inspiration, and that I love it.<mask>And what makes me feel so good is the experience.<mask>It's the same energy that I was when I did my first race bike ride.<mask>I was 21 years old, but I didn't get the chance to ride at all.<mask>If <p0> was still alive, I wouldn't be doing this race ; I would only be setting the record as a professional cycling cyclist, and I wouldn'd be setting it as a personal goal.<mask>So I took the decision to make a personal commitment to the sport and to the people I love.<mask>This is all going to be happening in the coming years, as I write this for <p1>.<mask>As I prepare to begin the daunting and emotional journey of <p0> bike ride, I first need to understand how the journey unfolded.<mask>First, I have to explain how I am undertaking this journey.<mask>Many of you will ask, " What is it like to be the first professional cyclist in history to complete all five of these races?"<mask> <p3>, I will find that the adrenaline rush that accompanies a bike ride is almost overpowering.<mask> <p1> is like going into a dream and trying to go out on a field of mind, and this is just one of those challenges.
<mask>The move follows a report by <p0>, the independent panel that found the bank's business environment has stagnated for years and could eventually get worse.<mask>" Credibility is an imperfect building block for an economy that is still fragile," said <p3>, director of global operations and strategy at <p0>.<mask>In its report, <p0> said it will cut nearly 50, 000 employees and close 40, 000 positions at <p4> by the end of this year.<mask>The group also said it would eliminate or eliminate a range of positions at retail and offshore banks that could provide financial stability.<mask> <p4> is a low - performing entity with a history of expanding and shedding senior bankers.<mask>At the height of the crisis, it was known as the " Cayman Whale."<mask>In April 2007, it lost nearly $ 17. 4 billion from its books.<mask> <p5> says it was hit by the 2008 financial crisis, and it then lost control of the balance sheet to <p6>, which lost nearly 6 percent of its money.<mask>Credibility has continued to stagnate for years, with <p2> announcing this month that it would cut an additional 50, 0000 positions.
<mask>The Swede has also revolutionized tennis with his methods for controlling the game.<mask>He has helped the game become competitive with innovations such as free pace, speed, volley and more.<mask>But he's not content with simply changing the game's game, as has been the case with his long - serving, 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 4 victory over <p4> in <p5> on Sunday.<mask>The reigning <p1> champion hit an ace to secure victory, which set up a clash with either <p6> or <p7>.<mask> <p2> claimed <p4> to win the Australian Open at Wimbledon in January, but there was speculation that his shoulder injury would keep him out of the Australian final.<mask>In fact, he said the <p1> will have to wait until he is fit to play the full eight - man showpiece in Melbourne.<mask>" <p3>, I think I've got to play this way," <p2> told <p8>.<mask>"[ But ] when I play a game, I have to do my best, because I'm playing well in the big tournaments."<mask>The move to pace and volley is a key to success in the game, which has had an unfortunate knock on its own.<mask>Last year, tennis was ruled illegal in the United States and most nations struggled to maintain their own set of rules.<mask>While players were allowed to adjust the ball, a series of court rules restricted the amount of space that they could move.<mask>It led to a rise in the number of points the <p7> could score, with <p9> ( <p10> ) a shot shy of 300, with the number now down to 120.<mask> <p13> : A history of men's tennis.<mask> <p0> has been a force in modern tennis since he was a young boy, growing up in a fishing town on the outskirts of Johannesburg.
<mask>" We were very lucky because we didn't see any houses either," said Changaris, who lives in the <p0> area.<mask>" It was just a matter of getting through the mud."<mask>But in the end, the two roommates made it through their final days together.<mask>According to a <p0> official, they had all made it safely to their houses -- a feat that requires a special levee system.<mask>But it's rarer than it is in the Colorado mountains, where flooding has been so extreme that neighboring homes are submerged and many residents live in basements.<mask>With little access to water, people in low - lying areas can expect to find themselves with no safe place to swim or ride their bike.<mask>Even so, their homes have become safer.<mask>The area has had minor flooding, but there has been significant progress in some areas, including the area around the city where the shootings occurred.<mask>Firefighters are still battling multiple weather - related fatalities.<mask>In one home, <p3> was killed after a tornado hit her.<mask> <p5>, the owner of a nearby wine and wine restaurant, said she lost her condo on August 2 after a flood knocked out her power, taking a power she had on her front door.<mask>After the house was destroyed, she said, she was able to get her power back to normal and get on the phone with her manager.<mask>There has been no word yet on the cause of death, though the apartment complex is surrounded by floodwaters.<mask> <p3> said she can't recall exactly what happened next.<mask>At first, she thought the couple left town on September 11 because of the flooding, leaving them without an emergency vehicle and feeling like they had no choice but to try to return home.
<mask>Yes, terrorist groups in Somalia and Syria have taken the lead in attacking American aviation and other aircraft targets.<mask>As the terror group expands, the United States will be watching carefully as it tries to make a dent in <p0> recruiting and fundraising and to build capacity that can be " used to help arm and train terrorist groups and to train them for attacks."<mask>A group already in the Arabian Peninsula ( <p3> ) is a global terror group, and one of the most brutalized groups in the region.<mask>Its recruiting, training and fundraising skills are the type to counter and train in groups that can carry out such attacks.<mask>But the extent to which the group is able to get the most out of its playbook is still unclear.<mask>It was <p0>'s most visible and most successful group in the early 1990s.<mask>The group was not able to expand beyond Somalia until 2001, after the <p1> - linked group killed President <p4>.<mask> <p2> was never able to reach the United Kingdom.<mask>Analysts say it's unlikely that the group will find its way into the United Arab Emirates, where <p0> has operated since 1999.<mask> <p4>'s government has made it clear that the United Sates want to see it.<mask>And though <p1> controls much of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, the group has not declared its independence yet.<mask> <p7> officials estimate there are about 100 fighters in the country, and the United Way has yet to determine the exact number of foreign fighters.<mask>So far, there's not a substantial amount of operational information.<mask>A large number of people may have been recruited by the group, as well as other operatives, but there's still no firm data to suggest exactly how many are currently in Somalia.<mask>Of the more than 30, 000 who've gone to Somalia, only five have gone on to go on to be terrorist operatives.
<mask>The droughts caused the river to draw more than two - thirds of its water from Louisiana, according to <p0>.<mask>The river is expected to run at 1, 800 cubic feet per hour through Thursday.<mask>Officials advised anyone living in the area to drink out of their pipes if their blood pressure is high, but not so much if not too high.<mask>" If a lot of people need drink their water, it is not safe for the environment.<mask>It is a red flag," said Dr. <p2>, a spokesman for <p3> <p4>.<mask>In addition to the drinking water advisory, health officials have ordered a flood watch in Plaquemines Parish, including the Lower Mississippi, where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico, to be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, <p0> said.<mask>There has been no response to the move from Plaquamines Parish to <p1>.<mask> <p3> has been monitoring the river since late May.<mask> <p1> is a <p5> and flows from south and westward to the Lower Gulf.<mask>Since then, seasonal seasonal rainfall has been limited to areas most impacted by the water crisis.<mask>But this has not stopped the flow from flowing into the Mississippi, the department said.

<mask>I was one of the first Americans to send my <p0> to space on a historic mission.<mask>To send my first astronaut on a space flight would have been amazing, but there is a real meaning behind it.<mask>As we mourn the passing of the 39th woman on <p1>, we also mourn the courageous contribution of the woman who led the United States to the goals of human exploration and the advancement of mankind.<mask>We will miss the woman on our <p1> spaceflight.<mask> <p3>, along with fellow space pioneers <p4>, <p5> and <p6>, who dedicated their lives to supporting women and space exploration, we have lost a brave pioneer.<mask>Our thoughts and prayers go out to the <p1> astronauts, crew members, the crew and everyone on the Earth who gave their time and energy for this great cause.<mask> <p0> : Share your view.<mask>On <p2>, I salute <p1>'s contribution to American spaceflight and a dream of someday making a difference.<mask>Over the last few decades, I have witnessed the advancement in human spaceflight as part of <p1> and its <p7>, which is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the launch of <p8>.<mask>The astronauts themselves have demonstrated the technologies that allow us to travel in space and we can continue to do so.<mask>In 2008, <p0> launched <p9> and <p10> to the international community in a historic achievement.<mask> <p5> will continue to work tirelessly to expand the international reach of space and explore the causes of human space exploration through <p1>.<mask>After retiring from the space program in March, Ride is stepping back in her role to help launch our first human space flight : In October, I will be joining in on the " Women in Space " project.<mask>My mission will be to set up <p13> ( ISS ) to launch astronauts who will go beyond Earth, and to promote human exploration in our world.<mask>I will continue working with my colleague and many others to bring the international space industry to a new level.
<mask>But just as human toll on the oceans is far from insignificant, the effects of climate change have not been very different from that of global warming, which is driving the cost of energy and food prices to our planet's detriment.<mask>As oceans continue to lose critical biodiversity resources, climate change has turned them into energy, not water.<mask>Scientists are now seeing a critical impact on coral reefs where we can no longer pollute and manage our own water, as they are in the Arctic and the Middle East.<mask>According to <p3>, one in three coral reefs is below the surface and more than 60 % of coral reefs are under threat.<mask> <p0> coral reefs, which are located in the northernmost parts of the world, are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather and storm surges, which have reduced protection for local populations in some places, including the crucial nesting sites in the Northern Hemisphere.<mask>These coastal areas are also at risk from the global warming which is threatening to radically increase the temperature and pressure on coral reef systems.<mask>But this is not only a problem that could cause extreme harm.<mask>Opinion : What we can learn from the devastation caused by climate change.<mask>Since we know so little about how we impact the oceans, we can do little to mitigate the impact of climate disruption and to prevent further loss of life, as the Arctic Ocean is already the poster child of climate action.<mask>On Wednesday, <p3> issued a global agreement for limiting climate disruption to the Arctic.<mask>The global agreement calls for the release of additional carbon dioxide into the ocean.<mask>To address this effect, ills such as pollution and climate change are urgently addressed on the water and oceans, where ocean life is continuously being exacerbated by shifting tides.<mask>" If the world continues to act, we will be able to reduce the world's carbon emissions by 50 % by 2030," <p0> statement said.<mask>Although the exact impact of this global change cannot be known due to the complex global situation, it is the obvious result.<mask>At the core of the global economic impact is climate change, which impacts more than 80 % of the Earth's carbon dioxide emissions.
<mask> <p0> said they arrested six suspects in the Thursday attack on a woman in New Delhi.<mask>The suspects were being held for questioning after the attack, they said.<mask> <p2> initially said they had detained the suspect, a 31 - year - old student from New Delhi who they accused of raping a woman at a bus station.<mask>But authorities said they were still trying to establish a motive for the attack.<mask>In the northern state of Bihar, police said they came across a man who had been accused of rape by another woman at the bus station, and then beat him with bricks after trying to identify him as a man, police reported.<mask>Police said they found his body on the ground.<mask> <p3> also said police found his passport and vehicle during the raid.<mask>On Thursday, police arrested several men in connection with the attack who were charged with kidnapping and murder.<mask> <p5> is also suspected of rape.
<mask> <p0>, 30, was convicted in 2009 of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving without the influence, but he is now free on bail.<mask> <p1> Judge <p2> sentenced him to 51 years in prison for the 2008 crash in which Adenhart and <p1> were killed.<mask> <p0> was sentenced last year to two years in jail for the 2007 crash.<mask>The victims are <p0>'s wife, <p3>, <p4>, and <p5>, a mother of six who also was a victim, the prosecutor said.<mask>A memorial service has been scheduled for October.<mask>Adenhart, 25, pleaded guilty in June in a federal courtroom to DUI manslaughter and cocaine possession charges.<mask> <p4> and Adenhar were sentenced to life in prison on each counts.<mask>Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence <p0> to 24 years after he pleaded guilty to the drunken driving and driving with the influence charge, which carries a maximum penalty of five years.<mask>In January 2007, Adenhod was sentenced to eight years in state prison for DUI manslaughter in the 2008 death of Adenhant.<mask>He pleaded no contest to a lesser charge.<mask>During Wednesday's sentencing, obar acknowledged being an " idiot " but said he was drinking and at the time the impact of the crash was devastating.<mask>" This was a terrible accident, not a tragedy," said <p0>, who was accompanied to the courtroom by her father and lawyer, <p6>, who watched the sentencing.<mask> <p5>, whose parents were married to Adenhut, pleaded no plea to the charges last year.<mask>But Adenhad and Admendor were friends for almost five years, working together for <p1>, according to <p7> affiliate <p8>.<mask>They were in their 20s when <p0> was convicted of DUI manslaughter, it said.
<mask>The brainchild of Google Senior Vice President <p0>, the giant search engine is launching a new operating system that will allow users to " navigate, navigate and organize around " virtually any problem.<mask>" Google Now is not just a product," he told <p3>.<mask>A first - person focus on how users interact with the network will be a key part of the system.<mask>The system, currently available on Google's Local Hub, will connect to a map app to give users a way to navigate the network using Google Maps -- a type of database that is more intuitive and easy to learn.<mask> <p0> said the Google Now interface would allow users " to navigate objects in a more intuitive, orderly way."<mask>The new operating systems will be built on <p1>'s <p4> operating system and will run on the Google Chrome OS operating system.
<mask>In the summer, if you're in a car or heading out on a journey in the ocean, the sky will be clear and blue ; on a trip to the coast, you'll be the only known sign that the plane is awake.<mask>You may notice a significant change in that that day : The sky is blue.<mask> <p0> are no longer the most visible part of the landscape.<mask>" We do think they can improve the way the ocean looks, but they will also change the way we experience the atmosphere," says <p3>, editor of <p4>, who founded <p5>.<mask>He said the sea change is a result of a global phenomenon : the ocean change.<mask> <p4>'s waters are the most intense in the world, meaning the ocean has the largest population density on average of 646, 000 people.<mask> <p2>, however, has a much quieter take : Each year, only 13 % of the planet's population is surveyed by <p4>.<mask> <p7> are still occupied by large areas of the ocean.<mask>For those without a good vision, <p3> says, many of these rooms, with a capacity for 300 - plus people, make sense.<mask>So while there are differences between the two kinds of homes, " The ocean is still quite beautiful.<mask>It's the same shape in terms of landscape -- it's still quite clear that it's green, it's not grey -- but it's grey," says the editor, who also covers commercial aviation, with <p0>.<mask>They are even cheaper to rent : $ 1, 200 to $ 1 - 200 for a full - service <p7>, or $ 1. 60 for a complete three - bedroom villa.<mask>Prices rise.<mask>With prices soaring, always wanted to build out the neighborhood, so <p3> and <p3> took a look at five of the world's best urban spots.<mask>1.

<mask>The announcement is a key step forward in <p0> goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by about 3 % by 2020, and the goal of a U. N. climate change summit by next year.<mask>But there are a number of questions about the agreement.<mask>Firstly, how does it compare?<mask>China and America can lead by far in greenhouse gas reductions and then on a massive scale?<mask>In recent years, both countries have tried to cut their carbon emissions by more than 5 %, but the United States has resisted.<mask>It's difficult to say how much more a significant reduction that would occur, but a deal like this would likely come at a cost to both economies.<mask>In my opinion, the agreement would be an important step forward, but it's not enough to tackle global warming without increasing our carbon footprint.<mask> <p0> would still need to see a major deal with China in order to actually reach the agreement on its own.<mask>Even though this deal is based on <p0> agreement, there are concerns about how the United might be prepared for a major cut to the carbon pollution that is expected to come from its emissions by 2030.<mask> <p3> and China already have a strong collaborative agreement on the issue.<mask>And the <p0> deal will help both countries cut their emissions by significantly by the end of 2025.<mask> <p5>, it would help both nations cut their greenhouse gas greenhouse gas imports by roughly 50 % from 2005 levels.<mask>To reduce the risks, <p2> needs to encourage each country to reduce its emissions, by increasing exports to China.<mask>Additionally, " The United States would reduce our imports by about 40 % of our global emissions over the next two decades, and we've already seen this progress.

<mask>Drying out of a tube is a simple, dangerous and potentially life - threatening task.<mask> <p0> used an emergency toilet paper liquid to flush down the toilet in a desperate bid to make himself at least alive again.<mask>The toilet is not the only way to survive without toilet paper, but it's also the latest step in the long and desperate fight to survive.<mask>From South Korea to Australia and everywhere in between, people are running low on liquid -- but without toilet papers.<mask>" Everyone has a desperation level," said <p1>, an assistant professor of psychology at <p2>.<mask>It is a " desperate situation."<mask>" If you can barely see anything on the floor, it's extremely difficult for people to eat or drink.<mask>You need something that's just on your kitchen surface that's very specific.<mask>So I think you can only use one toilet paper for now," <p0> said.<mask>Read this : The'burdette'stick off.<mask>As a solution, it started in March 2010 when he went back to the bathroom with his toilet paper.<mask>He said he went there to check it out and realized it was only the first liquid and there were some other problems he could see on his floor.<mask>That turned out to be very severe dehydration and he started taking extreme measures.<mask>For the next two weeks, <p0> and his partner worked on the toilet paper to try to reach people who could have access to it, and they didn't.<mask>A call from the <p2> was made and the <p3> started getting calls from people concerned.

<mask>Today, those who once wail and rattle around frantically using the knuckles as they worked to get home are suddenly jostling for space on the knell of one of the most popular UK music studios.<mask>While the sounds of finger - tapping, pebbles and the thumping of drumming may sound a bit clunky, they can still be heard throughout the UK.<mask>It was here that the buzzing of knickets, and the raucous chatter of choral horns, have provided the soundtrack for the first ever sound - changing wave of electronic music.<mask>From the legendary recording studio of <p2>, to today's gritty industrial sound that still reverberates with a distinctive tone, to the sound of metal cannon, these sounds still echo across London's streets -- sometimes accompanied by sounds as metallic as a tin guitar.<mask> <p0> has taken the pulse of electronic songwriting to a whole new level.<mask>In the first decade of its existence, the London - based company has honed a sound system -- a sound wave that reverberates around the city and strikes a chord with a global audience that is far beyond its hardcore core -- since the 1970s, and, in the early 1980s, has become a phenomenon of sorts for music fans everywhere.<mask>The company's latest album, " Chasing Man," hit number 21 in the UK's singles chart, earning a strong cult following, while its soundtrack -- and now the likes of Rage Against the Machine, " Fight Club " and " Get It Through My Car " -- has been an instant hit on the UK charts.<mask>But with the advent of mobile - music, an increase in downloads and streaming services is hitting new ears, and its sound is resonating with a younger generation of audiences.<mask> <p2> is not just the latest app -- and a spate of artists from the UK -- to harness the power of live music, the latest offering from hip - hop music acts <p3> and the <p4>.<mask>What <p0> isn't releasing is a more traditional, more sophisticated mix of hip - pop beats and dance rhythms that have been championed by fans, the <p5>, and other music aficionados.<mask>There is a striking new wave of British artists -- and their videos are getting rave reviews -- on Twitter, which have since been taken to the <p11> and <p12>.<mask>" Chasing Amy " is now a big hit in the United States, taking more than 100 million views on Twitter.<mask>Its latest offering promises to be hugely popular with the
<mask>The rumors are rumors coming from the social media site <p0>.<mask>The 20 - year - old singer has been with <p1> since 2011 and, according to her latest song, " No Place Left Now," she's been with him since she was 14.<mask>( See the original story at EW. com.)<mask> <p1>, perhaps, just might have had a harder time fitting into the spotlight lately.<mask>In June, she tweeted, " Yes we are back together again :)<mask>( <p2>.)<mask># <p3> and I."<mask> <p4> singer <p1> then went on to say, " I am so happy the two of you have finally made it through these past few months."<mask>Since then, Swift has worked harder to re - establish her footing on the music scene, as the music industry likes to point out, with <p2>'s new single, " Hot."<mask>" No Excuse me.<mask>I don't know what all the sudden transpired here," she said in a statement in May.<mask>" It's been a whirlwind year for me," <p1> said.<mask>She added, " With all the work and determination that go into it, it's been really sad to watch both of them go through this together."<mask>While Swift has largely stayed out of the spotlight, her latest release, " 1989," has helped her make more headlines.<mask>Just last month, it was released as well : The release of her single " 1989 " has received a whopping 14 million views -- a total that's surprised everyone, considering <p6> magazine reported last month that Swift had sold 5 million singles, and even more releases of her album, " Downtown," a month before the new season is set to begin.
<mask>In a statement posted online Sunday, <p0> said its Mujahideen fighters had seized an oil rig in Jos, and it said two of its workers were being held hostage in an area of the city where the men work.<mask>The company has seen the released pictures before and said it had no further information to release.<mask> <p2> spokesman <p3> told <p4> on Saturday that there had been no demands from the government for ransom.<mask>But <p2> threatened more if the government does not halt its oil wealth exports.<mask>" More hostages would be taken.<mask>We have said through intermediaries and we will take all appropriate measures to secure their release and we are now working with the Nigerian government and <p1> on the matter.<mask>This is not a war.<mask>It is an emergency situation.<mask>Our position is that we do not tolerate kidnappings and armed attacks," <p0> leader <p5> said, according to the group's statement.<mask> <p5> also said that in the next few days, more Western workers would be released from the site and taken to other countries where the group is based, <p6> reported.<mask>As a result, more companies in Nigeria are being held.<mask> <p4>'s <p7> and journalist <p8> contributed to this report.
<mask>" The Internet is not for everyone," said <p0>, a police officer in Nakuru, a town in northwestern Kenya's <p1>, where thieves often target innocent civilians with phone and computers.<mask>" It is not just for the police and community, it's for all citizens."<mask>As of Monday, there were about 6, 500 total residents in Nakiri, about 160 kilometers ( 124 miles ) from the Kenyan capital, Kibera.<mask>The man, who police say was a 22 - year - old computer consultant, was arrested and charged with two counts of armed robbery in connection with the Sunday morning robbery, which took place in Nakulai, said <p1> Police Chief <p2>.<mask>He said authorities are investigating the case to determine whether the culprit was connected with the internet.<mask>Residents in Nakui have been using Twitter, an online service that was unavailable to many of the residents before the Internet gained access in 2007, when Kenyan law enforcement shut down internet networks in many parts of the country.<mask> <p8>, a resident of Nakuru who shares a wife with <p0> and uses the Web, said the cell phone is a " reliable link " to connect with his neighbors in Nakilai.<mask>After gaining access to the Internet, residents were able to share photos, video and stories.<mask>They also could draw their own conclusions from the videos and comments on the Internet.<mask> <p0> said he is more concerned about the effects of the Internet on the community than he is for criminals.<mask> <p4>, a 27 - year old taxi driver, was in a bus at the time of the attack.<mask>Police have asked people in Nakukula to send in images or video from the Internet to him.<mask>In the <p1> area, mobile technology is becoming a big weapon in an increasingly violent crime scene.<mask>Several law enforcement agencies have joined forces with nonprofits to combat the viral flood of information on the Web.<mask>A Facebook page recently started for <p0> has already attracted about 2. 6 million page views since it launched in February 2010.
<mask>Let's get it together.<mask>A series of online chatter on the social network has been going on since last Friday, when a group of tweets to a group saying " You deserve more?"<mask>faced the discussion on Twitter.<mask>According to the group, the letter was sent to " a woman who is getting the message."<mask>" Dear @ <p2>.<mask>I just found that she had sent me this.<mask>This is not my message," one tweet read.<mask> <p0> of the <p3> group said it received the letter, but was not aware of it.<mask>Somehow, <p0>, who has written more than 8, 000 posts since Thursday and whose words and tweets have already been verified by the group <p4>, responded on Twitter :.<mask>" Hi everyone.<mask>@ mymaniMy message was about you.<mask>So it's <p0>'s, what?"<mask> <p3>, a social networking site that tweets about issues around the world, said <p5>, the group's director of communications, called it " outrageous."<mask>The group said its Twitter account has since been deleted.<mask> <p5> said a separate account that tweets the group says is being used to solicit donations was not created by Twitter to get it up to speed.
<mask> <p0>, 26, is suing <p1> for $ 72, 000 in tuition and other costs.<mask> <p2> is the attorney in <p3>, California, which is the target of the class - action lawsuit, which alleges that <p1> violated the alma mater's " sole contract " by failing to provide the university with job training.<mask>The lawsuit argues that " the al mater never provided the required training " that led to the loss of job opportunities, and did not include a job in the application.<mask>A spokesperson for <p1> declined to comment on the suit, which <p0> filed on Monday.<mask>" <p1> does not claim that <p0> provided the appropriate training or employment that required," said the spokesman.<mask>He said he could not comment on pending litigation.<mask>However, he said, <p2> has acknowledged the suit is an " important and necessary litigation matter " and said, " It is part of a long - term effort to recover unpaid bonus payments.<mask>In addition, the lawsuit also alleges that the almenia provided <p4> with the cost of her tuition, <p5>, <p6> and other benefits, as well as the cost, and the costs of the alumnus'support for her actions, including her hospitalization and expenses.<mask>There is no mention of any money the almania claims it will collect.<mask> <p4> does not offer a comment on whether it is involved in the litigation or the university.<mask> <p1> acknowledged in a statement that it has no intention of filing a new lawsuit, and said the al almama mater would not comment.<mask>According to <p12>, the al menia and others filed the lawsuit on January 10, the third day of classes were not on campus at <p1>, and there was no sign of a post - graduation protest.<mask>At the time of the lawsuit, the complaint filed on January 17 said, "( H ) e have no relationship with alma alumnae mater."<mask>It alleges that after completing their studies, <p0> graduated from <p13> in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in English with a <p14>.<mask>Although she graduated in 2006, <p4> says she is still enrolled in classes, so the suit does not include the cost.
<mask>What sets them apart from the usual weapons is that the guns are actually old, made from silver or precious stones.<mask>They've been found in the custody of Belgian police, but it has yet to be determined whether they were stolen, <p0> said Wednesday.<mask>In the <p1>'s possession is six AK - 47s -- worth between $ 1. 3 million and $ 1 million -- reportedly made from the stones, which are used to record ammunition.<mask>The weapons are said to be a prototype of what could be a future attack by <p1>, who was involved in a successful counter - terrorism operation in Yemen in 2010, <p2> said.<mask>According to <p1> spokesman <p3>, <p1> officials were unaware of any armed threat until a bomb disposal unit carried out the retrieval.<mask>It's too early to speculate on whether the weapons were stolen or if they were made in Yemen.<mask>He said : " We have no specific intelligence.<mask>This is a small matter and not a mass of weapons.<mask>But if it were to go forward and make an impact, we would be very confident that the <p6> would not get into this."<mask> <p2> said the team was in close contact with Belgian authorities as they worked to confirm the find.<mask> <p4> is a national security organization.<mask> <p8> said its special forces have been deployed overseas to help thwart the rise of armed terrorist groups such as <p9>, the <p10> and <p11>.<mask>And the <p8> said in a statement Wednesday it was working with French authorities to identify and seize the weapons.
<mask> <p0> took gold for the United States in the women's long jump at <p1>, while <p2>, who was a teenager, also took bronze.<mask>The 29 - year - old is seeking her second individual titles after the double in the 5, 000 meter men's 4, 000m last week.<mask>" I'm just delighted to win another gold and I'm very excited about it," she told the official <p1> website.<mask>In a third gold, England retained their track and field volleyball rights after winning the 50 meters individual pursuit.<mask>A day after the women finished the long jump, England took the relay gold in the men's 50 meters.<mask>London won its first ever 4, 200m event.<mask>India followed up the 4, 500m by triumphing in a thrilling 10 - minute sprint.<mask>England had already claimed the men 1, 000 meters and 1, 500 meters gold before <p8> from Great Britain came out on top in the 100m.<mask> <p5>, who won the 4x100m relay and the 50m relay, took bronze in the process.<mask>Britain's <p4> claimed a silver medal in the long jumping.<mask> <p3> also won the long jumper gold.<mask> <p9>, who retired from sprinting after just five months of surgery, finished fourth in the distance to move clear of England's <p10> and Australia's <p11> in the sprint.
<mask> <p0> and stuffed foxes fly over <p1>, the historic community in which it draws about 1, 500 visitors a year.<mask>But this year's " Leaky Wings," a spectacular bird - watching spectacle in which the animals crawl close to a speeding car, was hatched years ago.<mask>" The goal of this show is to get people involved," said <p2>, the editor - in - chief of <p3>, which has seen more than 500 exhibits during its two - year run.<mask>Read more : Opinion : Wild boater safety tips to U. S. economy.<mask>The event started as a summer event at the historic PopTech Fair.<mask>A few months earlier, <p1> had passed the annual car crush, a major event that had been dubbed the " drunken boater."<mask> <p2>, then in his late 80s, began a lifelong passion for the " safety net," or netizens of the town.<mask> <p1>, now 86, was born in Charleston, West Virginia, a community of about 17, 000 people about 70 miles east of Charleston.<mask>Since then, <p3> has been working to improve safety net safety across the state.<mask> <p5> and <p6> have developed a way to gather citizens in the community to gather and consume food, drink and generally celebrate such events as the <p1> contest.<mask>As a result, more than 90, 000 locals, many of whom are retired, attend the festival each year, each year.
<mask> <p0> said he did not believe the current cap of paid athletes will be lifted by <p1>.<mask>" We've had more successful academic seasons than I think anyone else would have had to put forward," <p0> said at <p2>, referring to the <p3>, which was created in 1994 to give universities more flexibility in determining how they can make top - dollar salaries, including whether they will continue to offer free athletic scholarships.<mask>Under the new cap, which <p5> will adopt next year, college athletes in major <p3> and <p2> universities will continue their education, but only on top - ranked teams.<mask>The <p3> will decide whether to accept full - time scholarship athletes instead of playing on the <p6> level.<mask>It is in this context that the <p1> administration has agreed to a pay cap that is currently in place but has yet to be enacted, <p0> told reporters.<mask>He said the current formula will ensure the revenue is not used for college sports and that the revenue stream will be in place for other sports.<mask> <p2> President <p7> also said he was encouraged by the <p4> administration's recent decision, which will lead to " greater productivity and revenue streams " for <p2> and other top schools.<mask>In January, the " NCAA <p1> unanimously adopted a rule that sets out basic principles of revenue sharing that could have a significant impact on top college teams and other programs, such as those at <p8>, and its schools," <p7> said in a statement.<mask>However, some critics say the changes are needed to preserve profitability and ensure there is an " equitable playing field for all programs that operate on the merit of each <p10> and other <p11>."<mask>The current cap, enacted by <p12> in October 2011, does not apply to <p2> or <p2> sports and does not include revenue sharing for Division I football or basketball.<mask> <p13>, the president of the <p14>, said it has a duty to protect <p2> interests and that it needs to take action against any " persistent unfair treatment or differential treatment of the players."<mask>He acknowledged that " many <p8> universities have suffered financial problems."<mask> <p2> football players have long complained that they are being paid for the money they make.<mask> <p7> noted that <p2> President Dr. <p15> recently had said there are no plans to raise the <p16>'s revenue threshold by 2012.<mask> <p6> President <p17>
<mask>But what do they mean?<mask>There are a series of things to consider.<mask>1.<mask>A free and open economy.<mask>The world's largest gathering of summits brings together leaders from more than 50 countries and often the world's most powerful.<mask>They've had no less than two years to get this agenda straight.<mask>During the last four years of negotiations between Europe's main parties, <p0>, Russia, China and France, <p1> ( <p2> ) mediated talks in Budapest in early 2008.<mask>Russia became the first country in the world to invite the U. N. to <p4> ( UNAS ) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.<mask>Yet the last nine months have been marked by high - profile defections, disputes and legal wrangling.<mask> <p6>, a European diplomat for <p7>, who was arrested in March 2009, was charged with tax evasion, illegal migration and international bribery.<mask> <p1> was released a few days later and promptly posted bail.<mask>At the G8 summit in Berlin, the leaders of the United States, Britain and Germany were expected to discuss <p3>, which was in an apparent attempt to quell the crisis at the summit, but the U deliberations only progressed when German Chancellor <p8> was caught by surprise by a German reporter who had a press conference following the summit.<mask>2.<mask>Global warming.<mask>To achieve this goal of reaching the summit was essential to the global economy and to build trust between the two countries, and to encourage development and growth.
<mask>Not quite, says <p0>.<mask>They both live in Beijing and both have lived in exile in the United States for 30 years.<mask>" I was always interested in movies, music, theater and theater," the singer says.<mask>When I first arrived in Beijing in 1997, he was the star of " Midnight in Paris," a movie about three prison men and two musicians who each played the role of a small, fragile puppet.<mask>As soon as <p0> first heard the film's soundtrack, he started working on it.<mask>Then <p0>, who plays a small but mysterious puppet named <p1> in " Midnight " spoke of how he became enthralled with the movie's central character.<mask> <p5> in Beijing, the two musicians had been scheduled to perform a movie called " Midnight Midnight " on the U. S. jet bound for Washington.<mask>After a few hours, both singers had been released from <p2>, a prison in Wenzhou, in southwestern Shaanxi Province.<mask>At the time, the <p2> official was " angry," and told me he had asked <p0> if he could take over his role.<mask>For the next six years, <p1> was at the front of a room packed with high profile movie stars.<mask> <p7> as the mysterious wizard of <p8>, " Midnight is a crime scene in <p8>," he is best known for playing a three - string band of actors from <p9>.<mask>He also starred in " Funny People," a 1997 film about a prison - bound former inmate who was sent home from jail on a life sentence for murdering his mother, <p10>.<mask>Despite his popularity, <p5> is less than popular in China.<mask>China regards dissidents as political prisoners and <p6> was reportedly killed by Chinese soldiers in 2006 during the <p11>'s rule.<mask>The real catalyst for the rise of <p7> is the recent rise of Han Chinese political parties, despite Beijing's tight restrictions on political dissidents and Han people living in exile.
<mask> <p0>'s CEO <p1> announced on Wednesday that he plans to announce his first offering to Google in the next three months.<mask> <p1> believes that starting in November, you'll be able to save money by reducing your phone bill, whether it's a phone bill or if it's just a software update or your text message.<mask>" If we can reduce your bill by a few percent and then give you a more accurate estimate, that should be an amazing first step," he said.<mask>This would also mean saving $ 45 for every version of your phone, which already costs less than a <p2>.<mask>The <p0> would not reveal how much of <p2>'s bill it is consuming, but it may cost you to subsidize the sale of your existing smartphones to pay for the new phone you bought.<mask>Google has been working around the clock to develop phones that run the company's operating system.<mask> <p3> has reported that if you buy a phone for $ 200, you're going to pay a pretty penny.<mask>Would the deal?<mask>If not, then you're likely to get less money from <p0> and <p4>.<mask>But how much is this?<mask>To figure out how much your bill will take, we'll need to compare the basic concepts.<mask>And if the cost of each phone is less, the company could then be able, for example, to " save money, buy more than a half a cup of coffee in a few seconds " by making the purchase more cost effective.<mask>So what's the likelihood?<mask>For instance, what's your bill - bill balance?<mask>How much is it?
<mask>His most recent book is " The Will to Save Iraq : The Search for Peace and Security in Iraq," which is available online through <p0>.<mask>Until this week, he was a research adviser to the U. S. ambassador to Iraq.<mask> <p1> says Iraq has had a lot of challenges.<mask>NEW YORK ( <p0> ) -- The Iraqi parliament voted to extend the election to April.<mask>The vote, however, is not about how many people voted, and it is about how much they had to change to participate in the Iraq elections.<mask>This is the first time that Iraq has held a referendum on a proposal that would grant legal status to a member of parliament with no involvement in the political process.<mask>Although many of the parties that voted to expand the voting process -- and the Iraqi government and political establishment that has been organizing since 2008 -- had strong objections to the proposal and some people voiced their doubts.<mask>But the Iraqi people chose to vote for the proposal that was free and fair.<mask>They were happy to learn that there were strong differences between the opposition and <p3>, and many said they believed that the government would allow the referendum, if not in whole, and that it could be imposed by the Iraqi authorities.<mask>At the end of February, as the parliament's work began, Iraqi officials announced that <p4> had been re - elected.<mask>With the new government in place, Iraq's civil war is winding down.<mask>There is still much work to be done to clear the way for <p4> to seek the government to get his term.<mask>If the current government can still come to terms with the new elections, then <p4> will be the one to make that happen, but as long as he is in power and the people in power decide to accept it, he could continue to fight for Iraq.
<mask>The Convair A320neo, carrying an estimated 1, 000 passengers, entered service in the U. S. in 2011 with a flight that flew for eight hours over the Atlantic Ocean.<mask>The passenger plane flew to the <p1> capital, Seattle on Monday and arrived in San Francisco on Wednesday evening.<mask>While the aircraft is expected to make its final journey to Los Angeles, other planes are in the final assembly process.<mask> <p1> is the parent company of <p2>, one of many privately - operated airlines that currently have aircraft in the market.<mask> <p3> was founded in 1970 and <p2> is the largest privately - owned aircraft manufacturer.<mask>Aside from the two <p6> 747s, all the new aircraft have been built by <p2> and its affiliates, including the aircraft's manufacturer <p7>.<mask>" This is our biggest aircraft to date and this is the ultimate in the best - of - five airplane program," said <p4>, President and CEO of <p3>, which has been flying the plane for 18 years.<mask>On its inaugural flight in July 2010, the 727 became the first commercial passenger flight to reach the U, S.<mask>It was the first time a passenger aircraft has flown from <p0> to San Francisco.<mask> <p5>'s <p8> and <p9> contributed to this report.
<mask>It's unclear who is trying to kill <p0>, the Pakistani army chief who has been on the run for nearly a decade.<mask>And there's no sign of the elusive militant in his underwear.<mask>Here's what we know so far :.<mask>THE CRITIC.<mask> <p1>, the wanted <p2> leader and top <p3> leader for more than a decade, is believed to be hiding in the village of Kurram in Pakistan's North Waziristan.<mask>He was captured in June 2010, accused of involvement in attacks on <p4>, <p5> and <p6> hotels.<mask> <p4> leader is accused of being behind those attacks.<mask>Investigators believe he was killed in retaliation for his government's efforts to capture him.<mask> <p8> says <p1> and the group have killed at least 14 people in a five - year period.<mask>That has come under question after British authorities said they found clues to the whereabouts of <p0>.<mask>The Pakistani military confirmed Thursday that it has tracked down his family.<mask>There was no sign Thursday that British troops had killed <p1>.<mask>His family has described his capture as a kidnapping.<mask> <p2> was believed to have fled to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.<mask> <p0>, accused by U. S. authorities of involvement, is wanted in connection with the September 10 attacks on the United States.
<mask>" I intend to make sure that the criminal justice system is as comprehensive as it can be," <p0> said in a wide - ranging interview on <p1>'s " American Morning " on Wednesday.<mask>" This is a place where we are putting a focus on ending crimes and criminal justice."<mask>The billionaire conservative billionaire has criticized recent arrests and imprisonments in his country as well as the government for using " trickle - down " tactics to silence critics.<mask>He also says he hasn't won approval from <p4> yet to bring the issue to a vote.<mask>At a news conference Wednesday night, he also made a series of comments about the need for criminal justice reform in America.<mask>On his <p1> show Wednesday, <p0> was asked what he would do if the Republicans lost the <p5> nomination.<mask>Asked if he was concerned with criminal justice, he replied, " I wouldn't speculate.<mask>I just don't have an opinion on that."<mask>But he also mentioned a growing number of cases in which individuals are being incarcerated on their convictions for drug - related offenses.<mask>In an interview with <p5>'s " Morning Joe," <p1> said he doesn't think criminal justice is too complex to handle in an American society.<mask>But, he added, " If we can make it quicker for everybody -- all people -- to be able to get behind and get behind, it's a big step in the right direction."<mask>He said he's had an impact on his campaign.<mask>For example, <p1> has been working with <p6>, a conservative think tank, to create a plea fund for the inner - city community in Kansas City.<mask> <p0>, who has led Republicans in recent years and has contributed money to causes for other groups, said he didn't hesitate to use his own money to fight drug addiction as a strategy.<mask>During that interview, RELATED : <p1> talks about the new <p7>.
<mask> <p0> was a sniper with a rifle, a rocket - propelled grenade launcher and a high - flying rocket - launched rifle.<mask>Now, he's been discharged from the <p2>'s <p3> and on to California.<mask> <p0>'s fate still hangs in the balance.<mask>" It's a blessing to learn he had all the weapons in the car," his father, who has been a military veteran since 1989, told <p4>'s " American Morning."<mask> <p1> has been discharged twice during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, <p0>'s brother <p5> said Thursday.<mask>But <p0> still faces a battle that pits him against fellow soldiers.<mask> <p1> was one of 40 troops accused in a case that has been officially declared a felony and an involuntary manslaughter.<mask>Two of those killed were <p0>.<mask>Prosecutors said the killings, the first of which occurred August 2, 2004, in Fallujah, a flashpoint in the war between <p1> and his unit in Falluja, Iraq.<mask>The war started when Iraqi soldiers were dispatched to an insurgent site in eastern Fallujah to help with roadside bombs and fire attacks.<mask> <p11> reported that <p0> was shot and killed during a battle between <p3> troops and insurgents on August 6, 2005.<mask> <p7> media reported at the time that the <p3>, led by <p0>, had killed 17 Iraqi civilians.<mask>Since then, the United States has accused the <p11> of torturing some of its own soldiers, while other countries have accused the U.

<mask>It was clear he was thinking about financial sanctions that would hurt the church and its members.<mask>But when a letter was filed that year, the pastor was threatened with having " adverse financial consequences " because of the theft, the congregation said in a statement.<mask>The pastor had been trying to get them to sign a pledge on his church's Web site that he would not give the money back.<mask>" This is a situation that we are facing as a congregation and in the spirit of <p2>," said the statement released Tuesday by the church.<mask>In the letter, the church said it " fully supports the pastor's actions and will work with him and his congregation to make sure that we live harmoniously, that every member of our congregation is a part of our community and that we receive good news in their community when it comes to their faith."<mask>The message was the latest in a series of alleged financial scams that have rocked the United States in recent years, from financial scams to sex scandals.<mask>At the start of this year, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, ruled that the scheme was in violation of the country's financial laws.<mask>Two federal indictments were handed down in Oregon last week.<mask>They also have been handed down to the Georgia attorney general for investigations.<mask>Attorney <p10> said in his opening statement that he had met with the men, who made some initial statements that he " expressed concern " about the collection plate and asked them to make it payment.<mask>He said he had made a similar request to the collection plates, but the suits did not say how much money had been deposited.<mask>Now, after more than 20 days of investigation, the federal judge has ordered a hearing to determine whether the theft occurred because of " strong financial concerns."<mask> <p6>, who is representing the church, called the collection of plate " an embarrassment " to the church but said that it was necessary to ensure that it does not " undermine faith in the church or the church."<mask> <p3>, a lawyer for the church in Argyle, said the collection does not constitute a extortion attempt.<mask> <p4> have not decided whether to bring charges against the alleged thieves.

<mask>But while the decision is a step forward for <p0>, it won't be binding.<mask>He remains in the hospital in Brisbane, but his body has been suffering from kidney disease since 2008.<mask>Two doctors at the hospital said their tests revealed he had severe lung disease, and that he needed two machine - lift machines to be able to take him off the bed.<mask>Doctors also said they believed he had a heart defect, with the results suggesting he had blood clots on his lungs.<mask>" I had just finished having my first tracheotomy and it was very difficult," <p2> told <p3> affiliate <p4>.<mask>The decision drew sharp criticism in Australia, where doctors have made it illegal to transfer patients to a state for medical treatment once their patient is in a hospital, according to <p4> affiliate <p5>.<mask> <p4> has asked <p6> for help in finding a hospital that would allow them to take a patient's body.<mask>On Friday, <p0>'s family issued a statement through <p7> saying, " The ruling by <p8> has obviously not affected the implementation of any form of assisted dying in Australia.<mask>We welcome the decision."<mask>The ruling does not, however, mean <p1> will be allowed to die in early 2015, which would require him to take all necessary measures in the next six months, and there are no plans to allow it in the meantime.<mask>As a result, it would be the first time that a right - to - die advocate had to pay for the hospital's treatment, which was called " medically questionable."<mask>In an interview with <p3>, <p9> said the decision means that he would no longer have to pay as long as he continues to receive treatment.<mask> <p1> said he will not take this decision without waiting for other medical advice from the hospital.<mask>There is, however at least a partial chance of a positive outcome, he said.<mask>While it would mean <p0> may be able for some time to decide whether to die or be legally allowed to live, other legal experts say such a choice would be a far from guaranteed.

<mask>The order went into effect in January 2011, but has been quickly curtailed by <p0>, which recently signed a decree giving the state of emergency powers to military leaders until January 29, according to <p1>.<mask>The curfew was lifted by mid - February after protesters rallied, but continued to demand the repeal.<mask>Police and army units raided sites where former Islamist leaders had sought refuge in December, according the court's decision.<mask>On Tuesday, according <p2>, military officials said they still hadn't received the order, though police have arrested several people and arrested others who have been responsible for blocking them from entering the country.<mask>Meanwhile, military and police officials insisted they've gotten the order despite opposition efforts to keep them from going.<mask>" At this stage, we're still enforcing the state - of - emergency law as they have until January 31 to comply with the decision of <p3>," said Col. <p4>, a spokesman for the state prosecutor's office.<mask> <p2> didn't say what charges the former head of Egypt's army would face.<mask>But <p4> cautioned that the " current situation " could be confusing.<mask>A statement from <p4> said that <p3> -- ousted in the June ouster of longtime President <p5> -- could be one of the leaders accused of crimes against humanity and killed.<mask>It cited reports of " arbitrary arrests " and other abuses, including the killings of detainees and the arrest of hundreds of people " accused of collaborating with the <p7>."<mask>He also cited what he said was evidence of a " pattern of systematic human rights violations " by members of the Islamist - led Mafraq Imprisonment Group.<mask>Egypt's <p7> recently ruled that the army cannot arrest anyone under its leadership.<mask> <p5>, an <p6> - linked leader, was deposed from power in July 2013 after being found guilty of ordering attacks against Egyptian police and civilians.<mask>He has been in jail since then.<mask> <p12>'s <p13> contributed to this report.

<mask>But for <p0>, the fear -- fear that she would fall asleep in the middle of a racing sea, at the end of a race -- is something he dreads every day.<mask>" I always tell myself that if it was going to be a tough race, I would try and pull off the best I can, and I'm definitely going to fall asleep," he says, choking back tears.<mask>The 36 - year - old sailor will climb Everest to become the youngest man ever to sail <p1>.<mask>His climb is one of the most grueling in the history of the world's most famous race.<mask> <p2>, who holds the Guinness Book of World Records for the most consecutive consecutive consecutive time sailed the Everest.<mask>She has won more than 200 marathons, most of them for her own sport, and a record 60 gold medals.<mask>But this is the " Everest of the ocean " -- that's the fear of every competitor.<mask>At that time of year, her competitors typically only sail six miles.<mask>Watch more on the <p1> climb ».<mask>This time, <p1> takes a different approach.<mask> <p0> and <p3> describe the thrill of the battle ». com : The hardest part is the journey from the small port city of Hesnales, Mexico, to the ocean's edge.<mask>They have been sailing since 1978, and as each new year approaches, they are more determined to improve their sailing skills and reach the top.<mask>For <p2>, the climb is a challenge she knows herculean task : " The biggest challenge was getting over the 50 - mile first stage, then getting up early to get in the range of the sea and then to climb all the way to the top."<mask>" It's a tough job, but I think I've done it and we've made it."<mask> <p0> admits that she's motivated by her passion, and hopes to climb the Mount Everest.
<mask>Israel's move was in response to a court ruling that froze the assets of Palestinian citizens who have filed a criminal complaint against Israel over the alleged settlement expansion.<mask>" The Palestinians recognize the authority of the ICC to initiate criminal proceedings against Palestinians through the determination of their criminal cases," <p0>, spokesman for <p1>, said in a statement.<mask>He called the decision " a slap in the face to those who will pursue the right to freedom of movement."<mask>The Israeli government said it had no legal grounds to freeze the transfers.<mask> <p2> spokesman <p3> said he believed Israel's decision was a move to " escalate the international confrontation over the occupied Palestinian territories."<mask>" Israel will continue to engage with the international community to pressure the ICC in order to reach a settlement, so that both sides can move towards peace without interference from the international justice system," <p11> said in the statement.
<mask>In less than a month, the site has added more than 400, 000 people to its vast user base.<mask>And the company's annual report on revenue for 2011 continues to impress many analysts : A year ago, <p1> boasted 1. 1 billion users.<mask>On its blog, <p2> says that last year, the company was projected to be the largest advertiser for Facebook by revenue.<mask>However, it now has about a million fewer accounts than Google, which had about 800 million.<mask> <p3>'s CEO <p4> said in the earnings report : " This year we've seen a new era in our culture.<mask>We have new people and new faces.<mask>It's a new generation of leaders who have transformed our daily lives.<mask>... We've never seen such excitement in our history."<mask>The Facebook users are still the most active on the Web, and <p0>'s new CEO <p5> admitted in the report : Facebook is a " new place for people to share information."<mask>But despite <p0> numbers and data, the vast majority of Facebook users aren't as connected to the site.<mask>They are more likely to be connected to Facebook than people who follow <p0>.<mask>For example, according to <p3>, <p0> accounts account for about 1. 9 % of the global population and account for only 16 % of mobile phone use.<mask>This makes the site more popular than Google's Facebook Connect, <p4> argued.<mask>" It's a great way to get a deeper look into what <p3>'s like in the world of social media, both monetized and in - service," <p4> wrote.<mask>Facebook's Graph Search, which can be accessed through a smartphone, provides a much more detailed way to see how Facebook users use their Facebook data than Google.
<mask>No, I'm not saying they were all over the place.<mask> <p0> has canceled shows for the remainder of the year, and this was the first time a network would show at least four shows for <p1>.<mask>But the biggest difference between the time it has traditionally been on and the time the show is on is a network.<mask>We're supposed to get a few shows to start.<mask>And those are a number of networks, including <p1>, which has a handful of shows on the current season.<mask>It's a bunch of networks with a few regular repeats.<mask>The biggest question is whether <p1> and <p2>'s networks would be ready for that.<mask>A few times this year, networks have even let us know when they might start shows.<mask>One show, called " The Voice," has a " Voice " deal with <p8>, which shows that it will offer a full lineup of programming for the 2012 season.
<mask> <p0> held a closed - door meeting with legislators from both parties on Friday night and early Thursday morning.<mask>" After two days of very very successful discussions and very detailed discussions, it is clear we have reached a solution," <p1> said in a statement after the session.<mask>He called for political compromise on the contentious issue.<mask>In addition, <p0> called for a comprehensive agreement to address the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to kick in as part of a fiscal cliff deal with the <p2> that Obama and congressional leaders had rejected previously.<mask>However, <p1> insisted that all sides had agreed to a deal that could avoid the automatic spending cuts that economists warn could reach the deficit threshold and reach the threshold for reducing tax revenue for the year ending September 30.<mask> <p6> warned that if failure to reach a deal would result in major cuts in discretionary federal spending, including the amount of unemployment insurance he would consider, which would hit 7. 8 %, and 1. 1 % of Americans who would be eligible for jobless benefits.<mask> <p2> Press Secretary <p7> later said Friday that " not all sides agreed on what we would do."<mask>The president told reporters he wants to see an agreement before the start of January 1, when the new fiscal year begins.<mask>A deadline to meet by mid - January has been pushed back to September 30, but he warned that the timing of that deadline could " complicate " negotiations.<mask>The meeting also was to discuss steps to avoid the fiscal cliff -- a $ 1 trillion economic and environmental impact that could result from a recession next year -- with <p2> Republicans, including <p8> Speaker <p9>, who has called for Obama to negotiate on his own.<mask> <p0>'s comments Friday capped days of meetings that began as a discussion about what to do about the rising federal deficits and debt that <p1> has blamed on failing to address a public health crisis that's stoking widespread fear in the nation's capital and business.<mask> <p1> said he and <p9> were looking forward to " serious discussions " about the debt ceiling next week.<mask> <p7> said Friday morning that a deal was " far from certain," but indicated that " nothing could come of this without a major agreement."<mask>But he said there had been a lot of hard work on both sides to get their respective bills passed as the two parties worked out a framework for compromise.<mask>It was unclear whether Obama would meet his proposed parameters of the fiscal year 2013 tax cuts that <p7> said would increase the federal deficit by $ 3 trillion over the next five
<mask>Peruvian authorities say that they are stockpiling fins, which they say will be sold to restaurants, to be used to make shark bait.<mask>" They have been slaughtering dolphins for centuries," Peruvian environmental group <p1> told <p2>.<mask>Peru has already been using dolphins for years -- the practice being illegal from the point of view of environmentalists, who argue that fishing is illegal.<mask>But despite the government's ban on the practice, the country's fisheries minister said he could not stop all these dolphins from being killed because the fishing industry is still illegal.

<mask> <p0> had earlier been clear of the movement, which has spread to several major cities in the region.<mask>But the latest clashes come just days after Egyptian authorities arrested <p1>, a convicted terrorist who was serving an eight - year prison sentence for being responsible for the deaths of more than 70 people, a former <p2> official said.<mask> <p1> was released last week, but the latest demonstration is the latest in a string of similar incidents in the North African country that began late last year and was started by the same protesters that toppled <p3>.<mask>It's a significant departure from the mood that thronged the streets of Cairo last August, when protesters camped out for a month for what activists believe is a chance to show off their anger over the regime's inability to take meaningful meaningful action on their own issues.<mask>After an uneasy standoff between authorities and protesters, <p1>'s family members and activists are seeking to show their support, according to a source familiar with the situation.<mask>The source said the demonstrators are loyal to their main demands, but that they are also asking for higher limits on what government can do in Egypt.<mask> <p6> told <p7> affiliate <p8> that the group is not in any form of a coup but is simply marching to express their disapproval.<mask>" It is all the rage of our people," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, because he is not authorized to speak to the media and the <p5>.<mask>One of the main complaints against <p1> is that he has not been given enough information.<mask>That was the complaint he gave to <p8>, the source said.

<mask>There was no Israeli response to the incident, which the Israeli military says happened about 4 a. m. on a Palestinian side of the border, the military said.<mask>Syrian rebels have repeatedly claimed that their forces have been targeting militants in the area.<mask> <p1> said it was investigating the incident and was monitoring developments and " monitoring the situation on the ground."<mask>A <p1> spokesman said earlier that he believes it was one of two rockets fired by Syrian warplanes in the Golan Heights on Tuesday morning.<mask>The <p1> said the Syrian rockets landed near a military checkpoint and were fired from the eastern Golan toward Israel.<mask>At least four Palestinians were injured in one incident in Syria, a spokeswoman for the Syrian government said.

<mask>How could the international community help Ukraine go on a war footing?<mask>After all, this is a humanitarian crisis.<mask>There is no alternative to fighting <p0> or its allies in Syria, and it's just as much about peace and stability as fighting in Afghanistan.<mask>This is why Secretary of <p3> <p4> said Friday that Ukraine was poised to become a " natural disaster."<mask>But in the meantime, Ukrainians must be ready to move on.<mask>" We are facing a very serious crisis here.<mask>It's going to become an ethnic crisis. "<mask>The Ukrainian government in Kiev has been trying to calm the situation by arming and training its forces in the eastern regions, but President <p2> refuses to heed this advice.<mask>The West has been sending a new, much more sophisticated and capable army to the region.<mask>Meanwhile, the separatists have been laying siege to Ukrainian territory, cutting off supply, and taking over strategic oil tankers.<mask> <p5> has been a crucial ally and ally in the battle against <p0>.<mask>But the West is also sending a more muscular military response.<mask>What is happening inside Ukraine is not going to matter, but the extent to which <p0> is imposing its will.<mask>From now on, Ukraine will be in the same situation as it was in the Balkans -- but with a different outcome : a new Cold War, not a new war.
<mask>Karzai, who is seeking a second term in office, told <p0> that he'd welcome the development by establishing a Turkish consulate, the news agency said.<mask>" At the moment, the operation is ongoing.<mask>We have no information from the government about it," Karzai told July 19.<mask>An official with <p1>, also known as <p2>, would not comment further on Karzai's statements.<mask>The president, who has long argued for an independent Afghanistan, said there is no need for <p2> to be established there.<mask>He said there have been some " coercive discussions " in the past, " but they are not working very quickly," and that he wants the council to be opened.<mask>That development could help restart peace talks with the Afghans.<mask>Former Afghan President <p3>, a vocal critic of the U. S.- led war in Afghanistan, recently said he'd open a Turkish government office in Karzai.<mask>Karmen's announcement came hours after a U. N. summit in Switzerland indicated it was considering establishing an office for the terror group in Turkey.<mask> <p4> had hoped it would lead to an eventual peace process.<mask>But Karzai dismissed the idea, saying the United States is only interested in seeking a peace deal.<mask>Instead, Karzai said he wanted a two - person team working to come to Turkey " to establish an independent, democratic government that will respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and the rights of Afghan people and their decision - makers."<mask> <p4> said the <p2> administration is interested in establishing an Afghan embassy in Turkey and wants the government to open its offices in Afghanistan.<mask> <p0>'s <p5> contributed to this report.

<mask> <p0> says <p1> and <p2> should be held accountable for their actions.<mask>( <p0> ) -- One week before the anniversary of the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre, President <p1> is poised to move forward on an effort to put a stop to mass shootings and to expand background checks for gun purchasers.<mask>President <p3> has promised to veto any legislation that would permit the assault weapons ban.<mask>But even if the President gets his way, it will be important to note that <p4>, which has been engaged in a fierce battle with Republicans to prevent an assault weapons assault weapons in the hands of murderous mass killings, doesn't represent a solution to the gun debate.<mask>The Second Amendment outlaws the use of deadly force in the workplace, but should the President take steps to end the indiscriminate slaughter of innocents by law enforcement, the Second Amendment is being violated by any measure that might expand background check.<mask>Gun owners have a right to keep and bear arms, as if they were the subject of a criminal trial.<mask>This is not about a constitutional amendment or anything else.<mask>These are not weapons.<mask>They are tools of the past.<mask>When we took action in response to the shootings in Newtown in 2011, it was a response to a longstanding crisis in our gun laws.<mask>We took action after the Newtown shootings in which 13 students were killed and many others injured.<mask>Our action resulted in the unprecedented public mobilization and intimidation of <p6>, and we've won an unprecedented number of congressional seats in the <p7> and <p8>.<mask>To the best of our knowledge, <p8> holds only 45 seats in <p9> and is a minority.<mask> <p1> and others are pushing for <p10>, the same legislation that has passed the <p11> and <p12>, to allow a ban on assault weapons through the federal courts.<mask>Like many gun owners, he is a Republican who, as a <p11>, is trying to expand the reach of the Second Mile to include a proposal to ban the sale of ammunition, gun parts and accessories to armed groups.

<mask>The card was a classic card -- a key card -- traded to <p0> when players were still on the roster, where they played until the 1975 World Series.<mask>" This card is not something you're going to get into lightly," said <p6>, the vice president of sales at <p7>, the auctioneer.<mask>The bidding for the card, one of seven that is under investigation by the <p0> in their investigation of <p8> -- comes amid a scandal that has shaken the <p9>.<mask> <p2>, in a statement released after the bidding, said he was " deeply saddened " by the scandal.<mask>He also regrets the difficulty of bringing this card to the game he loved as a boy, he said.<mask>An <p0> report last year described how fans were treated after the cards were sold, some of them being stolen, for their value or that there were instances of excessive amounts of cards sold.<mask>It was never made public.<mask>At that time, <p6> said, the card's value was $ 2. 1 million.<mask>That makes it " the highest ever sale ever for any baseball card."<mask>The auction is being held at the Mount Sinai Center in New York, where the card was found in a field.<mask>People who bought the card were not able to take it seriously.<mask> <p5>, a <p9> spokesman, declined to comment on the case.<mask>One man said he had never seen a card that was an " archaeological treasure " but that, if authenticated, will provide a <p0> insight into the trading card's history.<mask>In its presentation, the Hall of Fame says it has " collected all the major cards that were sold during the 1970 World Series."<mask>" <p1>'s catalog is the source of countless incredible treasures -- from baseball memorabilia to the original documentation of the league," said the <p1> statement.
<mask>For starters, he doesn't have to tell me he's not a good fighter.<mask>He has to tell us how to use fire, which he does.<mask>Which is why the Obi - Wan Kenobi voice is so powerful and powerful, particularly when he speaks English.<mask> <p0> as Obi - <p1>, he seems to be trying to communicate with his fellow Obi - Men.<mask> <p2> and <p3> aren't exactly friendly, but if they need a break, he can tell you how to do that.<mask>And, even as he's introducing themselves, I've already got one of his greatest questions in mind.<mask> <p6> the Obi's ability to communicate clearly.<mask>This was a guy who was really born in the'hood and was trained to do all the fighting in the Force.<mask>But now, when the Obi Obi - 10 Kenobi voice changes, you might be surprised by how badly he uses his voice to communicate his experiences and <p6> might just see him as <p7>.<mask>That's what makes the voice so effective :.<mask>" Obi - Won't lose his instinct to communicate.<mask>It's not only about conveying his values but also trying to make sure <p0> is a little bit sensitive.<mask>So he's using that instinct and... he tries to communicate that to the <p3>.<mask>I think we've all seen that with the attendant ( who can't hear what Obi - won says, " <p3>, that's a hard thing to say but I can imagine that if you are not listening to your brain and your mind you might hear it."<mask>It all leads to a misunderstanding :.

<mask> <p0> Officer <p1>, 32, died of " multiple gunshot wounds " inside <p2> in Upper Manhattan around 1 : 30 <p3> ( 3 : 30 p. m.<mask>ET ), said Commissioner <p4>.<mask>The suspect fled the store, and the officer shot him multiple times.<mask> <p7> said <p1> was being treated and released.<mask> <p1> fled the scene shortly after 3 p. p., police said.<mask> <p6> spokesman <p8> confirmed that the suspect is a clerk for <p9>.<mask> <p0> is a department spokeswoman.<mask>" The store has been evacuated," the <p6> said in a written statement.<mask>It said the store is still operating.<mask>No arrests have been made.
<mask>And for many Americans, the uncertainty is bad news.<mask>The president is making a point of pointing out that <p0> " will remain " the nation's most powerful agency until <p1> makes a definitive judgment about whether it is safe to continue to fight <p2>.<mask>In the coming days, <p0> will continue to insist that its policies are based on the long - term promise of <p1>.<mask>" <p2> has a very short history of producing policy that involves the best combination of the best ideas in the best interest of the nation," <p0> said in announcing his policy agenda Tuesday.<mask> <p5>, a former <p6> adviser, and <p7>, former chairman of <p0>, have spent the past two decades working together to push <p1> forward.<mask>They have spent years working on legislation that builds on what they already have and moves forward on it, such as the <p12> reform package and the implementation of <p13>.<mask>That's why <p2> is constantly using what it describes as " a credible alternative to <p1> " -- namely, expanding government programs.<mask>It's no coincidence that Efforts to undermine <p0> and <p1> come during an extraordinarily challenging time in American history.<mask>What is so troubling is that this debate can come back to haunt us in the years to come.<mask>Although some argue that the president is wrong on his commitment to reversing the trend, many have argued that the key to the success of <p2>'s policy approach is to bring out the worst.<mask>I have been there.<mask>Over the last eight years, my clients, myself and my team have been involved in making a number of economic decisions to restore the confidence of the American people.<mask>Some of those decisions have had a long - lasting effect on the economy.<mask> <p0> is a great example.<mask>A lot of the people at <p5> are now using a policy reversal of course.
