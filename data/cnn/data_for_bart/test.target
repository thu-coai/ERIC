<mask>John P. Surma, vice chairman of trustees, said that President Graham Spanier was being replaced and Paterno, the longtime head football coach, would not finish the remainder of the season.<mask>Tom Bradley will be Penn State head coach in Joe Paterno's absence.<mask>Rod Erickson, executive vice president and provost of the school, will be interim president, school officials said.<mask>Spanier has been president of the school since 1995.<mask>Earlier, Paterno, 84, issued a statement saying he was " absolutely devastated by the developments " involving a former assistant football coach and two university officials and that he would end his 46 - year tenure as head football coach at the end of the season.<mask>The trustees decided to move that timetable up.<mask>" I grieve for the children and their families, and I pray for their comfort and relief," Paterno said.<mask>" With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."<mask>Paterno's contract is set to expire at the end of the season.<mask>Some had called for him to resign immediately because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant, who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, now 67, sexually assaulting a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex.<mask>Paterno reported the allegations to his boss.<mask>Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared Paterno had met his obligations under state law, but critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police.<mask>Sandusky, who was arrested Saturday, is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and " corruption of a minor " involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youths, prosecutors said.<mask>Two Penn State officials are accused of failing to report the alleged abuse.<mask>The U. S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year.<mask>
<mask>The houses in this community surrounded by peach and apple orchards look more like homes you would find in the American Southwest than in Mexico.<mask>On top of a hill stands a gleaming white Mormon temple, a rarity in this largely Catholic country.<mask>Miles Anthony Romney is a resident in this community called Colonia Juarez and a practicing Mormon.<mask>The 50 - year - old owner of orchards and a fruit packing plant says his family descends from Mormons who settled in this area more than 125 years ago.<mask>" They established the apple orchards, the peach orchards, farms, ranches, and that's basically what we do today," Romney said.<mask>" We come from a hardworking family.<mask>We come from honest people."<mask>Romney tied with Obama in latest poll.<mask>Miles A. Romney's great - grandfather led the first group of Mormons to the state of Chihuahua, the same Mormons to whom the family of U. S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney traces its heritage.<mask>In fact, Mitt Romney's father, George -- who also ran for president in the United States -- was born in this area himself in a town called Colonia Dublan.<mask>And Miles Anthony Romney is Mitt Romney's second cousin.<mask>Miles Romney is so proud of Mitt Romney's political career that he managed to get a Romney bumper sticker sent to Mexico which he proudly displays on his pickup truck.<mask>He also has a Romney campaign sign on his window.<mask>And he says he can't understand why Mitt Romney's religion is an issue for some people.<mask>" I think it's a misunderstanding on their part.<mask>
<mask>Several universities issued similar warnings last year, but this was the first time the Texas law enforcement agency had issued the specific advisory against travel, said spokeswoman Tela Mange.<mask>In the past, she said, Texas authorities had just urged students to be careful.<mask>" Because of the increased violence, we decided to step it up a little bit and say,'Parents, bad idea,'" Mange said.<mask>DPS Director Steven C. McCraw said, " Parents should not allow their children to visit these Mexican cities because their safety cannot be guaranteed."<mask>The State Department renewed a travel alert to Mexico last month, citing increased violence in the country -- border areas in particular.<mask>" Recent violent attacks have caused the U. S. Embassy to urge U. S. citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan, Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua... and to advise U. S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution," the alert says.<mask>More than 16, 000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006.<mask>Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation.<mask>" The situation in the state of Chihuahua, specifically Ciudad Juarez, is of special concern," the alert says.<mask>Two U. S. citizens were abducted and killed in Chihuahua, the State Department said.<mask>" Mexican authorities report that more than 2, 600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009," the report states.<mask>" Additionally, this city of 1. 3 million people experienced more than 16, 000 car thefts and 1, 900 carjackings in 2009.<mask>U. S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports."<mask>But the problems are not limited to Juarez, the State Department says.<mask>" Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U. S.- Mexico border," the report says.<mask>
<mask>Scott Walker will launch a new political organization in the coming weeks and has tapped a national political strategist to serve as his campaign manager should he decide to run for president, multiple GOP sources told CNN.<mask>Walker, who was sworn in to a second term in Madison this week, quietly brought on Rick Wiley, a former Republican National Committee political director and veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, about a month ago to build a political operation in advance of the 2016 race, the sources said.<mask>Walker's moves are the latest in a swirl of recent activity from big - name Republicans eyeing a White House bid.<mask>Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum have all maneuvered quickly since the New Year to hire staff, court donors and remove potential obstacles to running.<mask>Wiley, who declined to comment on the job, has been aggressively reaching out to potential staffers in recent weeks.<mask>And Walker himself will attend the RNC's winter meeting in San Diego next week to meet with committee members, including delegations from the early primary and caucus states that kick off the presidential nominating process.<mask>One source close to Walker told CNN that the governor has no timeline for announcing a presidential bid but will be forming " some kind of entity in the coming weeks to lend itself as a vehicle " -- likely a leadership PAC -- before moving forward with a full - blown campaign.<mask>Walker and his aides have said that he will not announce his intentions until after the Wisconsin legislative session concludes this year.<mask>A native midwesterner who once worked for the Wisconsin Republican Party, Wiley advised several gubernatorial campaigns, including Walker's, during the 2014 election cycle.<mask>He was RNC political director in 2012 and previously worked on the presidential campaigns of Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and George W. Bush's re - election in 2004.<mask>Wiley had also been mentioned a possible campaign manager for New Jersey Gov.<mask>Chris Christie.<mask>Wiley works at the same consulting firm, Mercury LLC, as a Christie's chief political guru Michael DuHaime.<mask>" The governor is definitely committed to putting a great team around him," the source close to the Walker said.<mask>Walker has demonstrated his political toughness with three statewide victories in four years â €” his 2010 election, a 2012 recall attempt after a bruising fight with Democrats and organized labor, and his 2014 re - election â €” and has a tightly - knit crew of aides and loyalists in Wisconsin.<mask>
<mask>The reason : it has one of the world's fastest rates of deforestation, mainly for palm oil production.<mask>As trees are felled, the carbon stored in them and the soil is released into the atmosphere.<mask>The United Nations Environment Program estimated that between 2003 and 2006, deforestation and forest degradation reached 1. 17 million hectares per year.<mask>Louis Verchot, a leading climate scientist, in Indonesia to measure carbon emissions through deforestation, illustrated the problem.<mask>" Around us here we have a very young oil palm plantation and around the oil palms you can see the stumps of the trees, this area was probably logged between three and five years ago," he said.<mask>" We're trying to understand how this change from forest through degradation to oil palm affects the emission of greenhouse gases."<mask>But there is a solution, in the form of the United Nations program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation ( REDD, which has Indonesia as one of its pilot countries.<mask>Through REDD, Norway has pledged to give Indonesia up to one billion dollars if it can prove a reduction in its emissions and halt deforestation.<mask>As part of its new commitments, in January 2011 Indonesia begins a two - year ban on any new clearing of forests.<mask>Agus Purnomo, National Council on Climate Change, Indonesia, said : " If you are living in area where there are no other economic activities you are bound to cut the trees.<mask>" But if there are other economic activities which will be created by this financial assistance then the local communities, the local companies and the local governments will be able to continue their economic development activities without damaging the forests."<mask>However, there is one group that has yet to be convinced, and that is Indonesia's indigenous population.<mask>Untung Abdullah, a spokesman for the Orang Rimba people, whose forest homeland has all but disappeared and who are now living in a state - controlled park, said : " The forest is very important for the Orang Rimba.<mask>We're born in the forest.<mask>The huge woods are our home.<mask>
