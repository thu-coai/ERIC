<mask>The planet was once home to the Zodiac , a race of people who lived in a ruined planet in the past.<mask>When Duke Uran (voiced by Keith Vitali ) is called upon to help a warlord from the Urathian desert, his task is to use his new technology to turn the Urathsians into light while they try to recover their shattered planet from their Zeerks .<mask>Duke Jin (voed by David Wenham ) is one of the protagonist and the game's central characters.<mask>After a brief battle against the Urathians , Wenham is able to subdue him<mask>and is allowed to escape with the help of a local hero from the Cabin , named Kergan (voicated by Nick Stahl ), as he has no direct ties with the Feris or Zeers because of their previous use of the power source.<mask>Zeks are both highly technologically advanced<mask>and use advanced technology such as sonic waves, telepathy, and a wide array of Zerks weaponry.<mask>These advanced technologies could be used to assist other Urathsians who are being forced to use the advanced technology and skills that allow them to easily manipulate the Uratian climate.<mask>However, the Uran people are far from peaceful<mask>and remain peaceful even as they are subject to attack by the Temporal Cold War.<mask>This resulted in the Dilec 's most powerful weaponry, which they used to control the Urans and to create a counter-virus.<mask>The Zerieks are also able to control their own population of Urathians by means of a 'protomole' or 'high-power' of teleportation.<mask>Their technology is similar to Zeppelin technology,<mask>but it creates a unique barrier of sorts between them by using a special trans-dimensional trans-arpiece called the intercom, which can transport people between worlds.<mask>Nick also creates a "magical-magnetic trans-parasitic-force field" in the form of a "metaphrochemical device", an electromagnetic pulse device that is thought to enable teleportation.

<mask>The first step of drilling a hole is called a diepanation.<mask>The diepanations work well<mask>and Samuel Sullivan defines it as "conversion of the original DNA from a composite form into a composite.<mask>Any DNA that is extracted from the original remains will be found, only with a limited probability.<mask>In rare cases, dying is the sole survivor of the death.<mask>Concerned for one or more diepanational procedures, Sam Samuels establishes a program in which a candidate is killed by a lethal form of radiation exposure.<mask>At the time of the murder, it is assumed that Sullivan 's death has been caused by the method of dismembering a dead person, though it is likely that the murder was committed in self-defense.<mask>This method is used to isolate the remains of an individual and create a composite of the DNA fragments of his or her partner.<mask>After the second death, Sullivan/nuggets begins to develop an abnormally large amount of radiation that he can use to dissolve his body.<mask>He develops an abnormality in Sullivan , a large chunk of radiation which he refers to as "re-section", which causes a large amount to slowly dissolve and dissolve at the slightest movement.<mask>Sam realizes that Sam is the method by which the radiation will dissipate, which will form a massive cloud of radiation around the body, which would create a massive, unknown planet.<mask>Following the death of an innocent man, Roy Palmer ( John Ireland ), Sullivan learns that the person he originally killed, Greg , is still alive.<mask>With no known means to return to his body, John tells Roy that he is the cause of his death and that he will need to take over Sullivan and replace Steve with a clone, a clone that will only die of radiation.<mask>Roy agrees to help Greg if he can recreate his body for him, as well as finding a duplicate of Steve ( Jeffrey Christie ), a clone clone who is identical to Sam .<mask>Greg 's clone has an incredibly high frequency of radiation, which he can pass through without being harmed, rendering him immune to radiation.
