<mask>Bruce Wayne returns home to Gotham City at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years,<mask>and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from Chicago.<mask>Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner Detective Arnold John Flass assaulting a teen for fun.<mask>On a surveillance mission to the seedy East End, a disguised Bruce is propositioned by teenaged prostitute Holly Robinson.<mask>He is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp<mask>and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix Selina Kyle.<mask>Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing.<mask>He reaches Wayne Manor barely alive and sits before his father’s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime.<mask>A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become a bat.<mask>Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from Commissioner Gillian Loeb, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon’s pregnant wife.<mask>In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats and humiliates him, leaving him naked and handcuffed in the snow.<mask>As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts<mask>, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves.<mask>Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a drug dealer’s bribe.<mask>After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham’s corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including Carmine "The Roman" Falcone, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.</s><mask>
<mask>The player begins in a tiny hamlet, near which he/she used to live.<mask>His/her farm has been destroyed<mask>and godparents killed.<mask>After clearing out an abandoned mine<mask>, the player finds a scrap of parchment that reveals the death of the player's godparents was ordered by an unknown enemy.<mask>The player then returns to the hamlet to find it pillaged,<mask>and decides to travel to Bjarnarhaven.<mask>Once in Bjarnarhaven, the player explores the levels beneath a nearby fortress, eventually facing Hrungnir, the Hill Giant Lord, responsible for ordering the player's godparents' death.<mask>Hrungnir carries the Enchanted Amulet of Kings.<mask>Upon activating the amulet, the player is informed of his/her past by his/her dead father, after which the player is transported to the town of Crossroads, and Part I ends.<mask>The game can be imported or started over in Part II.<mask>The town of Crossroads is run by a Jarl who at first does not admit the player,<mask>but later (on up to three occasions) provides advice and rewards.<mask>The player then enters the nearby ruined titular Castle of the Winds.<mask>There the player meets his/her deceased grandfather, who instructs him/her to venture into the dungeons below, defeat Surtur, and reclaim his birthright.</s><mask>
<mask>Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods.<mask>While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig.<mask>The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a "deadite".<mask>Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel and bury her near the cabin.<mask>The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen throwing Ash through the woods.<mask>Ash briefly becomes possessed by the demon,<mask>but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal.<mask>Ash finds little chance of safety, however,<mask>as the bridge leading to the cabin has been destroyed.<mask>Linda's revived head attacks Ash, biting his hand.<mask>Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw.<mask>Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless deadite Linda to death, killing her a second and final time.<mask>Then Ash's possessed right hand tries to kill him,<mask>and Ash is forced to sever his hand with his chainsaw.<mask>Ash then attempts to shoot the severed hand hiding in the wall of the cabin.</s><mask>
<mask>Expecting hostility because of her notoriety, she is surprised to be welcomed warmly by the dons,<mask>and rediscovers her old love of the academic life.<mask>Some time later the Dean of Shrewsbury writes to ask for help.<mask>There has been an outbreak of anonymous letters, vandalism and threats, apparently from someone within the college,<mask>and a scandal is feared.<mask>Harriet, herself a victim of poison-pen letters since her trial, reluctantly agrees to help, and spends much of the next few months in residence at the college, ostensibly to do research on Sheridan Le Fanu and to assist a don with her book.<mask>As she wrestles with the case<mask>, trying to narrow down the list of suspects and avert a major scandal, Harriet is forced to examine her ambivalent feelings about love and marriage, along with her attraction to academia as an intellectual (and emotional) refuge.<mask>Her personal dilemma becomes entangled with darkly hinted suspicions and prejudices raised by the crimes at the college, which appear to have been committed by a sexually frustrated female don.<mask>Harriet is forced to re-examine her relationship with Wimsey in the light of what she has discovered about herself.<mask>Wimsey eventually arrives in Oxford to help her,<mask>and she gains a new perspective on him from those who know him, including his nephew, an undergraduate at the university.<mask>The attacks build to a crisis,<mask>and the college community of students, dons and servants is almost torn apart by suspicion and fear.<mask>There is an attempt to drive a vulnerable student to suicide and a physical assault on Harriet that almost kills her.</s><mask>
<mask>The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime.<mask>Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people.<mask>Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot<mask>, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.<mask>General Friedrich Fromm, commander-in-chief of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one of those implicated in the conspiracy.<mask>Hitler removed Fromm from his post<mask>and named Himmler as his successor.<mask>Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS.<mask>He appointed Hans Jüttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy,<mask>and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men.<mask>By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS<mask>and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.<mask>By this time, Hitler had appointed Himmler as Minister of the Interior and Plenipotentiary General for Administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung).<mask>In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services.<mask>As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war.</s><mask>
