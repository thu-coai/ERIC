( CNN ) -- The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step Thursday of telling college students not to visit Mexican border cities during spring break because they are just too dangerous.|||<mask>Several universities issued similar warnings last year, but this was the first time the Texas law enforcement agency had issued the specific advisory against travel, said spokeswoman <p0>.<mask>In the past, she said, Texas authorities had just urged students to be careful.<mask>" Because of the increased violence, we decided to step it up a little bit and say,'Parents, bad idea,'" Mange said.<mask><p1> Director <p2> said, " Parents should not allow their children to visit these Mexican cities because their safety cannot be guaranteed."<mask><p3> renewed a travel alert to Mexico last month, citing increased violence in the country -- border areas in particular.<mask>" Recent violent attacks have caused <p4> to <p5> citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan, <p6>, <p7> and Chihuahua... and to advise <p4> citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution," the alert says.<mask>More than 16, 000 people have died in Mexico since President <p8> declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006.<mask><p9>, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation.<mask>" The situation in the state of <p10>, specifically <p9>, is of special concern," the alert says.<mask><p4> citizens were abducted and killed in <p10>, <p11> said.<mask>" Mexican authorities report that more than 2, 600 people were killed in <p9> in 2009," the report states.<mask>" Additionally, this city of 1. 3 million people experienced more than 16, 000 car thefts and 1, 900 carjackings in 2009.<mask><p4> citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in <p9>, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports."<mask>But the problems are not limited to Juarez, <p11> says.<mask>" Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.

( CNN ) -- Rainforest covers 60 percent of Indonesia, yet this developing country is among the world's highest carbon emitters.|||<mask>The reason : it has one of the world's fastest rates of deforestation, mainly for palm oil production.<mask>As trees are felled, the carbon stored in them and the soil is released into the atmosphere.<mask><p0> estimated that between 2003 and 2006, deforestation and forest degradation reached 1. 17 million hectares per year.<mask><p1>, a leading climate scientist, in Indonesia to measure carbon emissions through deforestation, illustrated the problem.<mask>" Around us here we have a very young oil palm plantation and around the oil palms you can see the stumps of the trees, this area was probably logged between three and five years ago," he said.<mask>" We're trying to understand how this change from forest through degradation to oil palm affects the emission of greenhouse gases."<mask>But there is a solution, in the form of the <p0> program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation ( REDD, which has Indonesia as one of its pilot countries.<mask><p2>, Norway has pledged to give Indonesia up to one billion dollars if it can prove a reduction in its emissions and halt deforestation.<mask>As part of its new commitments, in January 2011 Indonesia begins a two - year ban on any new clearing of forests.<mask><p3>, <p4>, Indonesia, said : " If you are living in area where there are no other economic activities you are bound to cut the trees.<mask>" But if there are other economic activities which will be created by this financial assistance then the local communities, the local companies and the local governments will be able to continue their economic development activities without damaging the forests."<mask>However, there is one group that has yet to be convinced, and that is Indonesia's indigenous population.<mask><p5>, a spokesman for the Orang Rimba people, whose forest homeland has all but disappeared and who are now living in a state - controlled park, said : " The forest is very important for the Orang Rimba.<mask>We're born in the forest.<mask>The huge woods are our home.<mask>
